# Part 0 — What changed, and why

*A 30-second orientation. Read this if the volume of decisions makes it feel like the paper is
being redesigned. It is not.*

## The paper's architecture has not changed

| | |
|---|---|
| **Thesis** | DFG-aware attention gives no consistent benefit on decompiled Android bytecode |
| **Mechanism** | JADX strips identifiers → DFG edges connect semantically empty tokens |
| **Contributions** | (1) end-to-end APK pipeline, (2) 200k DFG corpus, (3) negative finding + explanation |
| **Section plan** | 1–9, unchanged |
| **Experiments** | tests 2–9, same purposes |

All of this is as it stood on 2026-08-02. **What changed is the evidence underneath it, not the
claim on top of it.**

## Three things changed, in this order

**1. Data leakage — the original job (§5.1–5.3).** CodeBERT had trained on a different split than
every grader rebuilt, reading 93.4% instead of ~88.5%; tests 4/6/7 rebuilt a third partition
whose test set was 89.9% training data; and 7.28% of the test set was byte-identical to a
training sample. Cost: 2 retrains, script fixes, a duplicate filter. This was the whole reason
the branch exists — not new scope.

**2. Protocol asymmetries found while fixing #1 (§4.3).** Four of them, all the same class of bug
— *the two halves of a controlled ablation were not controlled*:

| Found | Asymmetry | Status |
|---|---|---|
| finding 1 | docs misdescribed which runs got the higher epoch ceiling | corrected |
| finding 2 | early stopping never fired; it was a fixed budget | fixed, now fires in all four |
| finding 3 | CodeBERT's arms scored at different precision (FP32 vs FP16) | fixed |
| finding 4 | text and DFG arms see different code lengths in two backbones | open (D5) |
| finding 5 | GCB+DFG optimises at effective batch 32 vs its text arm's 16 | open (D7) |

These mattered because the paper's claim is a within-backbone comparison at sub-percentage-point
margins. At that scale a protocol asymmetry is not a detail — it is the result.

**3. Documents that described a system that does not exist (§5.5–5.6).** The clearest case: every
doc said the scanner deploys GraphCodeBERT+DFG at threshold 0.60. Reading the notebook, it ran
GraphCodeBERT **text-only** at **0.45** and contained no DFG code at all. Nothing was changed at
the time — the documentation was corrected to match the system. *(The scanner was later moved to
UniXcoder text-only by choice, 2026-08-31; it has never been a DFG model, which was the point.)*

## The claim came out stronger

| | Before | After the 2026-08-12 reruns |
|---|---|---|
| DFG effect | reversed on CodeBERT, contradicting the claim | **all three backbones favour text-only** |
| Consistency | "no consistent benefit" — a shrug | **fewer FN, more FP, lower ROC-AUC in all three** |
| Early stopping | never fired | fires in all four runs |
| Scanner | believed to contradict the null-DFG finding | already text-only; no contradiction |

You now have a cleaner version of the paper you set out to write. The corpus, the pipeline, the
mechanism and the venue framing are untouched.

## What is actually left

Of the open decisions in §1.3, only **two change a number** — D7 (batch mismatch, 1 GPU run) and
D2 (Table 3's protocol, 3 runs). **D4, D5 and D8 are "state it plainly in the paper"**, not
"redo the work". Plus the six evaluation re-runs in §1.1, which were always part of the plan.

---

# Part 1 — Status board

## 1.1 Where the work stands

| # | Step | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix eval scripts: strip filename fallback, add duplicate filter | ✅ done 2026-08-03 |
| 2 | Re-run test-4, test-6, test-7 | ✅ **done** — test-7 and test-6 2026-08-15, test-4 2026-08-20 on GCB text-only |
| 3 | Retrain CodeBERT text + CodeBERT+DFG on Partition N | ✅ done 2026-08-04 → `training_notebooks/re_train/` |
| 3b | Retrain all four CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT runs on one protocol (10 / 2) | ✅ **done 2026-08-12** — early stopping fired in all four (§4.3) |
| 4 | Re-run test-2 | ✅ **done 2026-08-20** — 18,541 filtered, all six checkpoints confirmed |
| 5 | Re-run test-8 | ✅ **done 2026-08-20** — **Table 2b's artifact collapsed** |
| 6 | Re-run test-5 | ✅ **done 2026-08-19** — chart via `make_baseline_chart.py` |
| 7 | Re-run test-3 ×3 seeds, **or** relabel Table 3 as the 5-epoch config | ⬜ decision (§4.3) |

**Cost to finish**: 6 evaluation re-runs, plus 3 more GPU runs if Table 3 is re-measured and 1 if
D7 is closed by retraining.

## 1.2 What the paper can and cannot claim today

| Claim | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **DFG provides no consistent benefit** | within-backbone comparisons, Table 2 | ✅ **safe** — the core finding survives everything below |
| DFG lowers accuracy **and** ROC-AUC on all three backbones | Table 2 | ✅ **restored 2026-08-12** — the CodeBERT reversal was an artifact of the truncated text arm plus an FP32/FP16 mismatch; both fixed, and it reversed back (§3.2) |
| DFG trades false negatives for false positives | Table 2 | ✅ consistent in all three backbones |
| Training stability ±0.10% | test-3 | ❌ **withdrawn 2026-09-04** — warm-started from our own fine-tuned checkpoint, so it is not fine-tuning seed variance and is biased low (§3.3a). Re-run pending |
| Transformers beat TF-IDF | test-5 | ✅ both on 18,541: baselines 83.68/84.83 vs transformers 87.52–88.34 |
| Cross-architecture gap (Table 2b) | test-8 | ✅ **resolved** — collapsed to +0.34%, p=0.106. Retire *"model choice matters more than DFG"* (§3.4) |
| Per-source generalisation (Table 4) | test-4 | ✅ **re-run 2026-08-20** on GCB text-only, filtered (§3.5) |
| Deployment behaviour (Table 5) | test-6 | ❌ contaminated partition *and* model changed |
| Why DFG fails (Section 8) | test-7 | ✅ **re-run 2026-08-15, re-derived 2026-09-02** — 1,054 FNs on the filtered partition, distribution rebuilt (§7.1) |
| Real-APK calibration (Test 9) | scanner reports | ✅ **safe** — no split dependency |

**The headline result is safe; much of its supporting evidence is not.** That distinction drives
everything in Part 5.

## 1.3 Open decisions

| # | Decision | Blocks | §  |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~D1~~ | ~~Epoch ceiling~~ — **settled 2026-08-12**: all four CodeBERT/GCB runs on 10 / 2, early stopping fired in each. UniXcoder remains at 5 / 2, internally consistent | — | §4.3 |
| **D2** 🔄 | ~~Table 3: re-run at the new ceiling, or label it as the 5-epoch config~~ — **decided 2026-09-04: re-run.** `test_scripts/test_3_multiseed/test-3-seed{42,123,2025}.ipynb` are built and split-verified; three Kaggle sessions pending. Also fixes a warm-start defect the old notebook had (§3.3a) | Table 3 | §3.3a |
| ~~D3~~ | ~~Scanner ships GCB+DFG~~ — **retired 2026-08-12: the premise was false.** It ran GraphCodeBERT **text-only** and contains no DFG code at all. *Superseded 2026-08-31: the scanner was moved to UniXcoder text-only (§5.6); the point that it was never a DFG model stands* | — | §5.5 |
| ~~D4~~ | ~~Filtered vs unfiltered Table 1~~ — **settled 2026-08-20**: Table 1 is the filtered 18,541 from test-2; `results/models/*.txt` are unfiltered per-model figures and must not be mixed in | — | §3.1 |
| D5 | Sequence lengths differ between the arms of two backbones — disclose, or retrain to match | Tables 1–2, Section 4 | §4.3 |
| ~~D6~~ | ~~Best model changed~~ — **settled 2026-08-31**: no model is identifiably best (§3.1). The scanner instantiates **UniXcoder text-only**, and test-6 matches it. test-4 got its text-only path in `daa49a1` and stays on GCB text-only, which is fine — only test-6, the scanner and test-9 need to agree (§5.6) | — | §5.6 |
| **D7** | **GCB+DFG trains at effective batch 32 vs its text arm's 16 — retrain to match, or disclose?** | Table 2 GCB row | §4.3 |
| ~~D8~~ | ~~Threshold disagreement~~ — **settled 2026-08-30 on 0.45**, matching the deployed scanner. test-6 and test-9 moved to it. Chosen for recall, not F1 (§6.7) | — | §6.7 |
| **D9** | **LVDAndro windowing is broken (§3.5b): ±5 rows over a per-line CSV, so 83.3% of records are not valid Java and a `Log.x()` regex reproduces 82.95% of labels. Rebuild the corpus and retrain all six, or disclose and restrict what Table 4's LVDAndro row is used for?** | Table 4 LVDAndro row, §6.6 | §3.5b |

# Part 2 — The paper

## 2.1 Thesis

This project began as a positive claim — *"DFG-aware attention reduces missed malware by 28%."*
Rigorous re-evaluation showed that claim was an artifact of flawed methodology. Correcting it
revealed a more interesting and more publishable truth: **all modern transformer models converge
to the same performance on decompiled Android vulnerability data, whether or not graph structure
is incorporated.** The paper then explains mechanistically *why* DFG fails in this setting.

**Three-sentence summary**

> We build the first end-to-end system for DFG-aware vulnerability detection on decompiled
> Android bytecode at scale. Through a systematic empirical evaluation across three encoder
> backbones, we find that DFG-aware attention provides no consistent benefit over standard
> text-only transformers in this setting. Qualitative analysis of the most confident false
> negatives reveals the cause: JADX decompilation strips identifier semantics from DFG edges,
> leaving graph structure present but informationally empty.

## 2.2 Contributions

1. **End-to-end Android APK pipeline** — APK to function-level triage, with DFG extraction from
   decompiled bytecode.

   > ⚠️ **Narrowed 2026-09-02 after reading the scanner.** The old wording said "at scale across
   > Java, Kotlin and C/C++". That is true of **neither** code path on its own:
   > - `test_scripts/scanner-pipeline.ipynb` builds tree-sitter for **Java + Kotlin only**,
   >   collects `.java`/`.kt`, and has **no native-library extraction** — no `.so`, no `lib/`,
   >   no JNI. The JNI attack surface is outside what the scanner reaches.
   > - `dataset_creation_scripts/` has `DFG_c` and `DFG_java` — **C and Java, no Kotlin**.
   >
   > Cross-language coverage comes from the **corpus**, not the scanner. §6.9's JNI argument is
   > about the training corpus and must not be restated as a scanner capability.
2. **200k DFG-annotated vulnerability corpus** — large, balanced, not otherwise available
   publicly. Released deduplicated (§5.4).
3. **Informative negative finding with a mechanistic explanation** — the field assumes DFG helps
   on code; this is the first evidence it does not help on *decompiled* code, with a
   qualitative account of why.

> **IEEE Access framing.** The repo's older notes targeted MSR / EMSE / ASE, where the empirical
> study alone carries the paper. IEEE Access expects a system contribution alongside the
> empirical one, so **contribution 1 is promoted to co-equal** rather than supporting material,
> and **Related Work must be written from scratch** — nothing in this repository drafts it.

# Part 3 — Results

All accuracies below are on the **unfiltered 19,996-sample test set** unless stated. See §5.4
for the duplicate-filtered 18,541 alternative and decision D4.

## 3.1 Table 1 — Full model comparison

| Model | Backbone | Structure | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | FN | FP | Status |
|---|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| LR + TF-IDF | — | none | 83.6794% | 0.9202 | 0.9191 | 1,605 | — | ✅ |
| MLP + TF-IDF | — | none | 84.8282% | 0.9332 | 0.9348 | 1,454 | — | ✅ |
| CodeBERT | codebert-base | text | 87.6814% | 0.9571 | 0.9591 | 1,282 | 1,002 | ✅ |
| CodeBERT + DFG | codebert-base | DFG attn | 87.5196% | 0.9556 | 0.9574 | 1,223 | 1,091 | ✅ |
| GraphCodeBERT | graphcodebert | text | 88.2692% | 0.9571 | 0.9589 | 1,294 | 881 | ✅ |
| GraphCodeBERT + DFG | graphcodebert | DFG attn | 87.8593% | 0.9558 | 0.9570 | 1,054 | 1,197 | ⚠️ batch (D7) |
| **UniXcoder** | unixcoder-base | text | **88.3447%** | 0.9581 | **0.9594** | 1,217 | 944 | ✅ |
| UniXcoder + DFG | unixcoder-base | DFG attn | 88.3124% | **0.9582** | 0.9589 | 1,093 | 1,074 | ✅ |

**This is the table for the paper.** All eight rows are scored on the **same duplicate-filtered
18,541-sample test set** by test-2 on 2026-08-20 (`results/test2_auc_results.txt`), so the numbers
are mutually comparable and `accuracy = 1 − (FN+FP)/N` reconciles for every row. That settles
**D4**: Table 1 is the filtered set, and the per-model figures in `results/models/*.txt` are the
unfiltered 19,996 and must not be mixed in.

**Provenance verified before the run.** All six checkpoints were resolved by directory match with
no hardcoded paths, and each training run's own results file was read back and checked against
this document — see §4.3. Every model's filtered accuracy sits **below** its unfiltered figure by
0.06–0.96pp, which is the only direction possible when memorised samples are removed.

> **Uniform evaluation window — decided 2026-08-28.** test-2 scores all six models at a single
> 384-token window. Two were trained at a different length: GraphCodeBERT text-only at 512, and
> UniXcoder+DFG at 256 code + 64 DFG. Measured on the test set, **~6% of samples (≈1,150 of
> 18,541) are long enough for that to change what the model sees** — the other 94% fit inside
> either window. GraphCodeBERT text-only is therefore likely a slight *under*-estimate.
>
> **This is deliberate, not an oversight.** The paper's central claim is a within-backbone
> comparison, which requires every model to receive identical input. Scoring each model at its own
> training length would make each number individually more faithful while introducing a permanent
> confound into the comparison itself — GraphCodeBERT text would read 512 tokens against
> CodeBERT text's 384, so a win could not be attributed to the model rather than the context. The
> measurement error is bounded and disclosed; the confound would not be. See §4.3 finding 4.
>
> The **scanner is exempt** and runs at 512, matching its checkpoint. It compares nothing, so
> matching the training length is simply correct there (§5.5).

**UniXcoder text-only is the best model at 88.3447%**, with GraphCodeBERT text-only 0.08pp behind.
The eight-model spread is 4.67pp; the six transformers span **0.83pp (87.52–88.34%)**. That
convergence — not any individual number — is the paper's substantive observation.

> ⚠️ **The best-model ordering flipped again on filtering.** On the unfiltered set GraphCodeBERT
> text-only led at 89.23% with UniXcoder at 89.08%; filtered, UniXcoder leads 88.3447% to 88.2692%.
> The gap either way is well inside the ±0.10% seed noise floor, so **do not claim a best model on
> accuracy alone.** §5.6's choice of GraphCodeBERT text-only for the deployment experiments rests
> on architectural coherence and on it being what the scanner ships, not on it topping the table.

## 3.2 Table 2 — DFG effect per backbone

Delta is text-only minus DFG-aware, so **positive means text-only wins**. All on the
duplicate-filtered 18,541 set; p-values from test-8, 2026-08-20.

| Backbone | Text-only | DFG-aware | Δ Accuracy | Δ ROC-AUC | Δ FN | Δ FP | McNemar p |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CodeBERT | 87.6814% | 87.5196% | +0.162% | +0.0015 | −59 | +89 | 0.409 |
| GraphCodeBERT | 88.2692% | 87.8593% | +0.410% | +0.0013 | −240 | +316 | **0.037** |
| UniXcoder | 88.3447% | 88.3124% | +0.032% | −0.0001 | −124 | +130 | 0.879 |

**Text-only wins all three on accuracy, but only GraphCodeBERT significantly.** CodeBERT and
UniXcoder are statistically indistinguishable, and UniXcoder's is a rounding error.

**The consistent, reportable effect is the operating-point shift, not the accuracy loss.** DFG
reduces false negatives in all three backbones (−59, −240, −124) and raises false positives in all
three (+89, +316, +130). That trade is uniform even where the accuracy delta is noise. This is the
cleanest statement available:

> DFG-aware attention does not improve discrimination on decompiled code. It shifts the operating
> point toward recall — consistently fewer false negatives at consistently more false positives —
> while accuracy and ROC-AUC stay flat or fall slightly.

> ⚠️ **Do not write "DFG lowers ROC-AUC on all three."** It was true on the unfiltered set but is
> not here: UniXcoder's ROC-AUC is 0.9581 text vs 0.9582 DFG, a dead heat.

> ⚠️ **GraphCodeBERT is the only significant row, and it is the one with a known confound** — its
> DFG arm trains at effective batch 32 against its text arm's 16 (**D7**, §4.3 finding 5). The one
> result strong enough to report is the one whose training protocol was not matched. Either close
> D7 with a retrain or disclose the confound alongside the p-value.

### The CodeBERT reversal, resolved twice over

The CodeBERT row read **−0.305%** (DFG ahead) on 2026-08-04, carrying two confounds: a text arm
truncated at its epoch ceiling, and that arm scored in FP32 against a DFG arm scored in FP16. With
both fixed it read +0.105% unfiltered, and now **+0.162% filtered, p=0.409**. The reversal was an
artifact throughout. Keep the episode for Limitations: it shows how far a sub-percentage-point
ablation moves under a training-protocol asymmetry.

## 3.3 Table 3 — Training stability (multi-seed) ⚠️

GraphCodeBERT text-only across 3 seeds. Split seed pinned at 42; only the training seed varies.

> ❌ **Superseded 2026-09-04 — do not cite this table.** §3.3a explains why and what replaces it.

| Seed | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | F1 (macro) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 42 | 88.8278% | 0.9588 | 0.9596 | 0.8883 |
| 123 | 88.8928% | 0.9609 | 0.9625 | 0.8889 |
| 2025 | 89.0728% | 0.9596 | 0.9617 | 0.8907 |
| **mean ± std** | **88.93% ± 0.10%** | **0.9598 ± 0.0009** | **0.9613 ± 0.0012** | **0.8893 ± 0.0010** |

This ±0.10% is the yardstick used throughout to judge whether a delta is noise, so its own
status matters — and it does not survive inspection.

## 3.3a Why Table 3 is being re-run 🔄 **D2 decided 2026-09-04**

**The ±0.10% above is not fine-tuning seed variance, and it is biased low.**
`test_scripts/superseded/test_3_multiseed_warmstart/*.ipynb` sets

```
pretrained_encoder = ".../graphcodebert-train-text-only/saved_models/best_model_text_only.bin"
```

— **our own fine-tuned checkpoint**, trained at seed 42 on this exact training set. Each "seed"
deep-copies that converged encoder, re-initialises only the classifier head, and continues
training. All three runs therefore start inside the same basin, having already seen every
training sample. What ±0.10% measures is head-initialisation and data-order jitter on a
converged model, not the variance of fine-tuning from scratch.

**This matters because of what the number is used for.** Table 3 is the yardstick for deciding
whether Table 2's deltas are noise — and the significant one, GCB text vs DFG, is **0.410pp**.
Understating the noise floor makes that result look sturdier than the evidence supports. The bias
runs in the direction that flatters the paper, which is the direction that has to be fixed rather
than disclosed.

Three further defects in the same files, all smaller:

1. **5-epoch ceiling** while Tables 1–2 use 10 / 2 (D1).
2. **Stale outputs.** `results/test3_seed*_results.txt` are dated 2026-08-02 and predate the
   duplicate filter — 88.8278% against Table 1's 88.2692% for the same model is the filter's
   absence showing. The *notebooks* were later fixed and do filter; only the committed outputs
   are stale.
3. **Each file reports "1 seeds".** Table 3's three rows are three separate single-seed runs
   stitched together by hand, not one multi-seed run.

> **Correction.** §4.3's option table says "Table 3's seeds ran at 512." They ran at
> `code_length = 384`. The claim is wrong wherever it appears.

### The replacement

`test_scripts/test_3_multiseed/test-3-seed{42,123,2025}.ipynb` — one notebook per seed, one
Kaggle session each. A cold-start run is ~5–9 h against Kaggle's 12 h ceiling, so three in one
session would die mid-run. The three files are byte-identical apart from the `SEED` line and a
closing "run this next" message, so the training configuration cannot drift between them.

> The superseded warm-start notebooks were moved to
> `test_scripts/superseded/test_3_multiseed_warmstart/` on 2026-09-04 so the two sets cannot be
> confused — running one by mistake costs a full session and returns the biased number this
> section exists to replace. `test_scripts/superseded/README.md` records why.

| | old | new |
|---|---|---|
| starting weights | our fine-tuned checkpoint | **`microsoft/graphcodebert-base`** (cold start) |
| epochs / patience | 5 / 2 | **10 / 2** |
| train `code_length` | 384 | **512** |
| eval `code_length` | 384 | 384 |
| test partition | filtered 18,541 | filtered 18,541 |

512 train / 384 eval mirrors `graphcodebert-train-text-only.ipynb` and test-2 exactly, so **seed
42 should reproduce Table 1's 88.2692%**; the notebook prints that comparison and flags a delta
above 0.5pp. The split cell was verified offline to produce sets byte-identical to
`split_and_filter.py` — 163,967 / 15,997 / 18,541 — and asserts those three sizes before training.

### Pre-registration — fixed 2026-09-06, before any warmup run existed

**Target n = 5.** Seeds 42, 123, 2025 first; 7 and 2718 afterwards **if GPU time
permits, regardless of what the first three show**. Reported at whatever n is reached, with
the critical value for that n stated alongside.

This is written down because the alternative is optional stopping. Running three, looking at
the p-value, and then adding two more *because the answer was unwelcome* would inflate the
false-positive rate and void the test. Fixing the target in advance means a later extension is
sequencing rather than a decision, and the record is dated in git.

**Why n matters more than usual here.** The analysis is a one-sample t-test of the seed
accuracies against the GCB+DFG checkpoint, and at these sample sizes the critical value
dominates:

| n | df | t critical | test fails if true sd exceeds | headroom on the observed 0.131pp |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **3** | 2 | **4.303** | 0.180pp | **1.4×** |
| 4 | 3 | 3.182 | 0.281pp | 2.1× |
| **5** | 4 | **2.776** | 0.361pp | **2.8×** |

At n=3 the failure line sits **0.8 standard errors** above the observed sd — inside the
measurement error, so a null result would not be distinguishable from insufficient power. At
n=5 it is 3.5 SE away. `test_scripts/aggregate_test3.py` prints this headroom on every run and
flags it when thin.

### First run in — seed 42, and what it cost us to learn ⚠️ **2026-09-06**

Seed 42 was re-run with warmup restored. **It reproduces the original procedure, and it does not
reproduce the original number.** Both facts matter.

| epoch | original (Table 1's run) | seed 42, warmup | Δ | seed 42, no warmup | Δ |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **1** | **86.45** | **86.4725** | **+0.02** | 87.5852 | +1.14 |
| 2 | 87.39 | 88.0103 | +0.62 | 88.3791 | +0.99 |
| 3 | 88.84 | 88.0728 | −0.77 | 88.4353 | −0.40 |
| 4 | **89.19** ← best | **88.9854** ← best | −0.20 | 88.9167 | −0.27 |
| 5 | 89.04 | 88.8479 | −0.19 | **88.9417** ← best | −0.10 |
| 6 | 88.86 | 88.8979 | +0.04 | 88.6041 | −0.26 |
| 7 | — | — | — | 88.8417 | — |

**Epoch 1 settles the config question.** It runs before divergence compounds, so it reflects the
learning-rate schedule almost purely: the warmup run lands **0.0225pp** from the original, the
no-warmup run **1.1352pp** away. Best epoch 4 and early stop at 6 in both, against 5 and 7 without
warmup. The schedule now matches.

**Final accuracy came in at 87.7569%, 0.5123pp below Table 1's 88.2692%** — same seed, same
verified procedure. Best validation differed by 0.205pp and **amplified 2.5× on test**, the same
validation/test divergence §4.3 records for CodeBERT+DFG. `manual_seed` does not control cuDNN
reduction order or the GPU the session lands on.

> **The check that flagged it was wrong, and the error is instructive.** It compared *final test
> accuracy* against Table 1 with a 0.30pp band. Replayed against both runs, that check **fails the
> correct configuration and rates the broken one as closer** (0.51pp vs 0.26pp). It has been
> replaced with an epoch-1 validation comparison against 86.45, which separates the two by **50×**
> (0.02 vs 1.14). Verify a run at its start, where the schedule dominates, not at its finish, where
> nondeterminism does.

**This raises the noise floor, and that is now the study's most consequential open number.** Two
runs of an identical procedure differing by 0.512pp implies σ√2 ≈ 0.5, so σ ≈ 0.36pp — against the
0.131pp the no-warmup trio suggested. That trio ran back-to-back in one week and never sampled
cross-session hardware variation, so it measured something narrower than replication.

It is a single comparison and must not be quoted as a variance estimate. But if σ is near 0.36pp
rather than 0.131pp, **Table 2's 0.410pp GCB delta falls inside seed noise**, and the paper's
conclusion becomes the cleaner one: no backbone shows a difference distinguishable from
run-to-run variation. That outcome supports the thesis rather than threatening it.

It also sharpens the case for five seeds. At n=3 the test fails if the true sd exceeds 0.180pp —
a threshold this finding suggests we may already be above.

**Known limitation either way.** Any n text seeds are compared against a *single* GCB+DFG
checkpoint, which is itself one draw from a distribution. The fully controlled design puts
seeds on both arms (~95 GPU hours) and is out of scope; it belongs in Limitations.

**What the result could do to the paper.** If the honest spread comes back **well under 0.41pp**,
Table 2's GCB finding stands and is better supported than it is today. If it comes back **near or
above 0.41pp**, the one statistically significant within-backbone result is inside seed noise, and
§3.2 needs rewriting. That second outcome is live — a cold-start spread is normally several times
a warm-start one — so this is a genuine test rather than a formality.

## 3.4 Table 2b — Cross-architecture significance ✅ RESOLVED

| Comparison | Δ Accuracy | McNemar p | Verdict |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| GCB+DFG vs CodeBERT+DFG | **+0.340%** | **p = 0.106** | ✅ **not significant** |
| GCB+DFG vs UniXcoder+DFG | −0.453% | p = 0.031 | significant |

### The pass/fail check on the whole remediation — passed

The first row was the single worst number in the project: **−4.546% at p ≈ 7.3e-114**, produced by
grading CodeBERT on its own training data. On the corrected checkpoints and the filtered test set
it reads **+0.340% at p = 0.106 — not significant.** The gap shrank by a factor of 13 and the
p-value moved 112 orders of magnitude.

That is what the entire retrain-and-refilter exercise was for, and it worked.

**Retire the claim *"model choice matters more than DFG structure."*** It rested entirely on that
row. What the data now shows is the opposite of a hierarchy: of five pairwise comparisons only two
reach significance, both around 0.4pp, and the largest cross-architecture gap in Table 1 is 0.83pp
across all six transformers. Neither backbone choice nor DFG augmentation moves the needle much.

The surviving significant row — GCB+DFG vs UniXcoder+DFG at −0.453% — carries the same D7 batch
confound as the GraphCodeBERT row in Table 2, since it is the same checkpoint.

## 3.5 Table 4 — Per-source breakdown ✅

GraphCodeBERT text-only on the duplicate-filtered test set, 2026-08-20
(`results/test5_per_source_results.txt` — note the +1 filename offset, §10.2).

| Source | N | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | F1 | FN |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **LVDAndro** | 7,482 | **97.5408%** | **0.9958** | **0.9754** | 110 |
| Draper | 6,856 | 84.0140% | 0.8964 | 0.8371 | 645 |
| Juliet | 1,815 | 100.0000% | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 0 |
| Devign | 2,388 | 64.7404% | 0.7189 | 0.6463 | 482 |

Macro mean across sources: 86.5738% / 0.9028 / 0.8647. The four Ns sum to 18,541.

Supersedes the contaminated Partition-S table (LVDAndro 97.07%, Draper 86.67%, Devign 68.91%, and
the tidy 7,500/7,500/2,500/2,496 counts). Two things changed at once — the partition *and* the
model, which moved from GCB+DFG to GCB text-only (§5.6) — so the rows are not a like-for-like
before/after.

**⚠️ LVDAndro at 97.54% must not be quoted as an Android capability number.** It is the only
source that is decompiled Android code, it is essentially untouched by duplication (1 sample
dropped of 7,483), and it describes the model the scanner deploys — but §3.5b shows most of the
figure is reproducible by a single regular expression, so it measures far less than it appears to.
*Supersedes the previous wording, "the number every Android claim should quote," which was written
before the LVDAndro paper was read and is withdrawn.*

## 3.5b What the LVDAndro row actually measures ⚠️ **audit, 2026-09-02**

Reading the LVDAndro paper (§8b.5) prompted a direct check of our own LVDAndro records. Two
findings, both measured on the exact 7,482 filtered test rows behind the 97.5408% above.

**Finding 1 — the labels are largely predictable from one token.** LVDAndro's ground truth is the
union of MobSF and QARK findings, and CWE-532 (*Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File*)
is among its most populous classes. In our test subset:

| | LVDAndro test rows | share labelled vulnerable |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| contains `Log.v/d/i/w/e(` | 2,672 (35.7%) | **96.8%** |
| does not | 4,810 (64.3%) | 24.7% |

The single rule *"contains a `Log.x()` call ⇒ vulnerable"* scores **82.95%** on this subset, with
no model at all. Fine-tuned GraphCodeBERT scores 97.5408%. The transformer is genuinely ahead, but
the honest framing is ~15 points over a one-line regex, not ~97% from scratch — and the residue is
plausibly further scanner signatures rather than semantic understanding. Draper, Devign and Juliet
contain no `Log.x()` calls at all, so this is specific to the Android source and does not touch
their rows.

**Finding 2 — 83.3% of our LVDAndro records are not valid Java.** Brace-balance is a weak
necessary condition for parseability, and by source:

| Source | brace-balanced |
|---|:---:|
| Juliet | 100.0% |
| Draper | 99.5% |
| Devign | 97.4% |
| **LVDAndro** | **16.7%** |

The cause is ours, not JADX's. `dataset_creation_scripts/lvdprocess.py` builds each record with
`window_radius=5` — a ±5-row window around a flagged line, joined with `\n`, giving the 11-line
records that are 96.6% of the LVDAndro portion. But the window is taken over **rows of LVDAndro's
CSV**, which are individual scanned lines, not consecutive lines of the original file. Adjacent
rows can be arbitrarily far apart in the source, so a record can concatenate unrelated fragments.
A real example (`LVDAndro_279755_file`, label 1) puts a `public class TutorialFragment` declaration
between two unclosed method signatures and ends mid-expression on `return String.valueOf(this.g`.

**What this does and does not affect.**

- ✅ **The central finding is unaffected.** DFG and text-only arms consume byte-identical inputs,
  so the comparison in Tables 1, 2 and 2b remains internally valid. Nothing about the null result
  depends on LVDAndro being well-formed.
- ⚠️ **Table 4's LVDAndro row cannot be read as "accuracy on Android code."** It is accuracy on
  11-row scanner-output windows whose labels are strongly signalled by a logging API call.
- ⚠️ **§6.6's LVDAndro–Devign gap is partly an artifact.** Some of the 32.8pp is a genuine domain
  gap; some is that one side is far more shortcut-prone than the other. The two are not separated.
- ➕ **It sharpens the mechanism, for the honest reason.** For 37.5% of the corpus the DFG is
  extracted from a best-effort parse of syntactically invalid input, so its edges can connect
  variables that never interacted in any real program. That is a stronger statement than "edges
  connect anonymised tokens" — but it must be presented as a defect we found in our own pipeline,
  not as a designed contribution.

**Not yet decided** — see **D8**. Rebuilding the LVDAndro portion with a source-line-aware window
is the correct fix and would require regenerating the corpus and retraining all six models. The
alternative is to disclose and restrict what the row is used for.

> ### ⚠️ Juliet stays at 100% — and duplication does not explain it
>
> The prediction was that Juliet would collapse once its 674 duplicated samples (27.1%) were
> removed. **It did not move at all: 100.0000% on 1,815 samples it never saw, zero false
> negatives.**
>
> So the mechanism in the Limitations argument is wrong. Juliet's perfection is not memorisation —
> it is that synthetic CWE test cases are *trivially separable*, holding structurally to a template
> the model learns in general rather than per-sample. §6.12 must be rewritten on that basis: the
> honest claim is "synthetic patterns are trivially easy even when unseen," which is a stronger
> reason to exclude Juliet from capability claims than duplication ever was.
>
> Devign remains the floor at 64.7404%, below the contaminated 68.91% — the scope boundary in §6.6
> is wider than previously reported, not narrower.

## 3.6 Table 5 — Deployment behaviour (imbalanced 90/10) ✅

UniXcoder text-only — the configuration `scanner-pipeline.ipynb` runs — on the duplicate-filtered
18,541 set at threshold 0.45 (2026-09-01, `results/test6_imbalanced_results.txt`).

| Condition | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | ROC-AUC | FPR | FN |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| balanced 50/50 | 88.37% | 0.8887 | 87.39% | 0.8812 | 0.9581 | 10.67% | 1,154 |
| **imbalanced 90/10** | **89.25%** | 0.4798 | **88.59%** | 0.6224 | 0.9608 | 10.67% | **119** |

Recall holds at 88.59% under a deployment-realistic class ratio, essentially unchanged from the
balanced condition — the model's ranking is stable, and only precision degrades as the positive
class becomes rare. Threshold rationale and the full sweep are in §6.7.

Supersedes the four-row GCB+DFG-plus-ensemble table on the contaminated partition. Three things
changed since: the partition, the model, and the threshold.

## 3.7 Test 9 — Real-world APK scanner calibration ✅

UniXcoder text-only at threshold 0.45, `code_length` 384. 13 APKs, 23,005 functions
(2026-09-01, `results/test9_scanner_calibration.txt`).

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Confidently safe (< 0.10) | **93.2%** |
| Uncertain (0.10 – 0.45) | 1.8% |
| Flagged (≥ 0.45) | **5.0%** |
| Highly confident (> 0.90) | 3.7% |
| Mean / median / std | 0.0525 / 0.0006 / 0.2026 |

**The calibration story is strong.** A median of 0.0006 with 93.2% of functions below 0.10 means
the model is decisive rather than hedging, and **74% of everything it flags scores above 0.90** —
these are confident calls, not borderline ones. The distribution is sharply bimodal, which is what
a triage filter should look like. The script verifies the global flagged count equals the sum of
the per-APK counts before writing, so the two halves of the table cannot disagree.

| APK | Type | Functions | Flagged | Rate |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| allsafe | deliberately vulnerable | 149 | 19 | **12.8%** |
| InsecureBankv2 | deliberately vulnerable | 88 | 9 | **10.2%** |
| de.danoeh.antennapod | FOSS podcast | 6,169 | 443 | 7.2% |
| AndroGoat | deliberately vulnerable | 371 | 26 | 7.0% |
| dvba | deliberately vulnerable | 77 | 5 | 6.5% |
| Vuldroid | deliberately vulnerable | 47 | 3 | 6.4% |
| Neo_Store | FOSS app | 2,939 | 169 | 5.8% |
| org.schabi.newpipe | FOSS media | 11,070 | 431 | 3.9% |
| InsecureShop | intentionally vulnerable | 336 | 12 | 3.6% |
| net.thunderbird.android | FOSS email | 95 | 3 | 3.2% |
| com.beemdevelopment.aegis | FOSS 2FA | 1,428 | 22 | 1.5% |
| calendar-fdroid-release | FOSS app | 236 | 3 | 1.3% |
| istark.vpn.starkreloaded | commercial sample | 0 | 0 | — |

> ### ⚠️ App-level discrimination is weak, and the paper must say so
>
> Deliberately vulnerable apps average **7.74%** against **3.80%** for FOSS apps — a 2.04×
> separation on the mean. But **the ranges overlap heavily**: AntennaPod, a clean podcast client,
> flags at 7.2%, *above* Vuldroid (6.4%) and DVBA (6.5%), both of which exist to be vulnerable.
> Three of six clean apps flag above the lowest vulnerable one.
>
> **Do not claim the scanner distinguishes vulnerable from clean applications.** It does not, at

>
> The earlier draft claimed *"deliberately vulnerable apps are flagged at significantly higher

> not survive and must be removed.

> **Supersedes 84.0% / 8.9% / 7.1%.** Those were computed at threshold 0.60 by GraphCodeBERT
> text-only with `code_length` 384 against a 512-token checkpoint — wrong threshold, wrong model,
> mismatched truncation. Not comparable to the table above.

# Part 4 — Methodology

## 4.1 Corpus

199,960 samples, strict 1:1 safe-to-vulnerable, four sources:

| Source | N | Vulnerable | Language *(measured)* | Content |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| LVDAndro | 75,000 | 37,500 | Java (100.0%) | decompiled Android — **all Android claims rest here** |
| Draper | 75,000 | 37,500 | C/C++ | NVD/SARD CVEs |
| Juliet | 25,000 | 12,500 | **Java (99.8%)** | synthetic CWE test suite |
| Devign | 24,960 | 12,460 | C | QEMU/FFmpeg |

> ### ⚠️ Juliet is a **Java** source, not C/C++ (measured 2026-09-02)
>
> Classifying every function body by content, **99.8% of Juliet is Java**, not C/C++. Several
> places in this document had it the other way round; §6.9 is corrected below. **Cross-language
> coverage rests on Draper and Devign alone**, and any sentence claiming Juliet contributes C/C++
> patterns is wrong.
>
> Found while writing Section 4 of the manuscript, by checking the corpus rather than the docs.

Keys are exactly `code`, `dfg`, `label`, `filename`. All 199,960 filenames are unique, so there
is no filename-group leakage — but APK-level provenance is not preserved, so **same-APK leakage
is unmeasurable without regenerating the corpus.**

## 4.2 Split

82 / 8 / 10 train/val/test, seed 42 → **163,967 / 15,997 / 19,996**.

> **Stop calling it "stratified."** `infer_source` looks for keys `source`, `dataset`, `origin`,
> `project` — **none of which exist in this corpus.** Every entry resolves to `"unknown"`, the
> split degenerates to a single group, and the result is a plain random shuffle.
> `results/models/codebert_results.txt` claims "source-stratified"; that is false. The paper
> must say **random shuffle, seed 42**.

This partition is called **N** in Part 5. It is the target end state for everything.

## 4.3 Training protocol — and the epoch-ceiling problem

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Checkpoint selection | best validation accuracy |
| Batch size | 16 train / 32 eval |
| Learning rate | 2e-5, AdamW, eps 1e-8, linear warmup |
| Gradient clipping | max norm 1.0 |
| Precision | FP16 (AMP) |
| Code length | 384 tokens |
| DFG node budget | 128 |
| Decision threshold | **disputed — scanner 0.45, everything else 0.60 (D8, §5.6)** |
| Max epochs / patience | **10 / 2** for the two runs being retrained; 10 / 3 for `graphcodebert-train-dfg`; 5 / 2 for the other three |
| Evaluation precision | FP16 (`autocast`) — **see finding 3 below; this was not uniform** |

> **Correction (2026-08-04).** The pre-consolidation notes said *both* GraphCodeBERT models were
> given the 10 / 3 ceiling. **Only the DFG one was.**
> `graphcodebert-train-text-only.ipynb` runs at 5 / 2 like the other four. Verified against the
> `Args` block of all six notebooks.

### What actually happened

| Run | Ceiling | Best epoch | Validation trajectory (%) | How it ended |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| `codebert-train-text` | 5 | **5** | 86.64 → 87.84 → 88.09 → 88.26 → **88.31** | hit cap, **still improving** |
| `codebert-final-dfg` | 5 | 4 | 86.63 → 87.74 → 87.89 → **88.32** → 88.15 | hit cap at patience 1/2 |
| `graphcodebert-train-text-only` | 5 | **5** | 86.45 → 87.90 → 88.71 → 88.86 → **89.04** | hit cap, **still improving** |
| `graphcodebert-train-dfg` | 10 | 5 | outputs cleared | had genuine room |
| `unixcoder-text-only` | 5 | 4 | 87.22 → 88.55 → 88.94 → **88.99** → — | hit cap at patience 1/2 |
| `unixcoder-dfg-final` | 5 | 4 | 86.77 → 87.96 → 88.44 → **88.71** → 88.29 | hit cap at patience 1/2 |

**Early stopping never fired in any of the five 5-epoch runs.** Every one terminated on
`num_train_epochs`, not on exhausted patience. What the paper describes as validation-based
early stopping operated in practice as a **fixed 5-epoch budget with best-checkpoint
selection** — a materially different protocol, and one that §6.4's defence does not cover.

### Finding 3 — the two CodeBERT arms were scored at different precision

Found 2026-08-04 while sizing the retrain. Every model trains under FP16 autocast, but
*evaluation* precision was never made uniform:

| Run | Eval precision | Matches its pair? |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| `codebert-train-text` | **FP32** | ❌ |
| `codebert-final-dfg` | FP16 | ❌ |
| `graphcodebert-train-text-only` | FP16 | ✅ |
| `graphcodebert-train-dfg` | FP16 | ✅ |
| `unixcoder-text-only` | FP32 | ✅ |
| `unixcoder-dfg-final` | FP32 | ✅ |

**CodeBERT is the only backbone whose two arms were evaluated at different precision** — and it
is the same backbone whose DFG delta reversed sign. So that 0.31pp carried *two* independent
confounds, not one: a truncated text arm and a precision mismatch against its own comparator.
GraphCodeBERT and UniXcoder are each internally consistent, so their deltas are unaffected.

It also explains a timing oddity: CodeBERT text-only validation took 7:03 per epoch against the
DFG variant's 2:09, despite the DFG dataset doing strictly more work per sample.

Cross-backbone comparisons (Table 2b) mix FP16- and FP32-scored models, which is a further
reason those numbers are not clean — secondary, since Table 2b is already broken for leakage.

### Changes applied to the notebooks (2026-08-04) — ready to run

| Notebook | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `codebert-train-text.ipynb` | 5 / 2, FP32 eval | **10 / 2, FP16 eval**, wall-clock guard |
| `graphcodebert-train-text-only.ipynb` | 5 / 2, FP16 eval | **10 / 2**, wall-clock guard |
| `codebert-final-dfg.ipynb` | 5 / 2 | **10 / 2**, wall-clock guard |
| `graphcodebert-train-dfg.ipynb` | 10 / 3 | **10 / 2**, wall-clock guard |

After this, **all four CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT runs sit on one protocol — 10 epochs,
patience 2, FP16 evaluation** — with warmup the only remaining cross-backbone difference (0 for
CodeBERT, 10% for GraphCodeBERT), which is consistent *within* each pair and so cannot bias
either ablation. UniXcoder's pair stays at 5 / 2 with FP32 evaluation, internally consistent.

- **`codebert-final-dfg` is retrained even though it converged**, because the scheduler is
  `num_training_steps = len(train_dataloader) × num_train_epochs`: raising the text arm's ceiling
  also halved its LR decay rate. Left at 5, the two CodeBERT arms would have differed in epoch
  budget *and* LR schedule shape — trading one confound for two, on the one backbone whose delta
  is in question. It runs ~78 min/cycle against the text arm's ~64, so a full 10 epochs would be
  ~13 h; with patience 2 and its epoch-4 peak it should halt near epoch 6 (~8 h), and the guard
  covers the rest.
- **`graphcodebert-train-dfg` did not strictly need retraining** — it was already at 10 epochs
  with 10% warmup, so its LR schedule already matched its text partner, and patience 3 vs 2 only
  governs when training halts, not the LR trajectory or the checkpoint-selection rule. It is being
  rerun anyway for two reasons: it puts all four CodeBERT/GCB runs on one protocol that can be
  described in a single sentence in Section 3, and it closes the provenance gap in §10.4 — its
  stored training outputs were cleared, making it the only model whose reported numbers could not
  be cross-checked against its own notebook. Its new run will carry them.
- **UniXcoder is untouched.** Its pair is internally consistent at 5 / 2 with FP32 evaluation on
  both arms, so its −0.71pp delta is unaffected by any of this. It is the one backbone whose
  Table 2 row does not change.

- **Ceiling 5 → 10, patience left at 2.** The ceiling is what was broken; patience was not.
  Holding patience fixed keeps the retrain a single-variable change, so any movement in these
  two numbers is attributable to the ceiling alone. It also keeps them consistent with
  `codebert-final-dfg` and both UniXcoder runs, which are all at patience 2 —
  `graphcodebert-train-dfg` at patience 3 stays the lone exception.
- **Patience 3 would not have changed `graphcodebert-train-dfg` anyway**: it peaked at epoch 5,
  so it stopped at 8 rather than the 7 patience 2 would have given. Same selected checkpoint.
- **CodeBERT text-only moves to FP16 evaluation** to match `codebert-final-dfg` (finding 3).
  Changing the DFG arm to FP32 instead would have cost a third GPU run.
- **Wall-clock guard** (`time_budget_hours = 11.0`): measured cost is ~62 min/epoch training plus
  ~2 min validation once FP16 eval lands, so a full 10 epochs ≈ 10.7 h against Kaggle's 12 h
  session limit. Patience 2 makes an early stop more likely, so the full 10 is the worst case
  rather than the expected one. The guard stops after the last epoch that fits and proceeds to the test evaluation,
  which otherwise would be lost to a session kill. The LR schedule now stretches over 10 epochs
  rather than 5, so these are genuinely new runs, not continuations.
- **Stored outputs cleared** on both, since the source no longer matches them. The superseded
  runs' figures are preserved in `results/models/*.txt` and in the trajectory table above.

### ⚠️ Finding 4 — sequence lengths are not uniform either (2026-08-04, UNRESOLVED)

Read from the `Args` block of all six notebooks:

| Backbone | text `code_length` | DFG `code_length` (+ dfg) | DFG total | Code context matched? | Total matched? | Winner |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CodeBERT | 384 | 384 (+128) | 512 | ✅ **yes** | ❌ | **DFG** +0.31 |
| GraphCodeBERT | **512** | 384 (+128) | 512 | ❌ text sees +128 | ✅ yes | text +0.37 |
| UniXcoder | 384 | **256** (+64) | 320 | ❌ text sees +128 | ❌ text sees +64 | text +0.71 |

`unixcoder-dfg-final` additionally uses **train_batch_size 8** where every other run uses 16.

**The one backbone that matches code context between its arms is the only one where DFG does not
lose.** In the other two the text arm was given 128 more tokens of code than its DFG counterpart,
so "no DFG" is confounded with "more code". This does not overturn *"no consistent benefit"* —
that claim survives — but it changes what the comparison measures:

- **CodeBERT** asks *"does adding DFG help, holding code context fixed?"*
- **GraphCodeBERT** asks *"are 128 positions better spent on DFG nodes or on more code?"* —
  a legitimate question, but a different one, and the honest answer from its row is *more code*.
- **UniXcoder** cleanly asks neither: its DFG arm has less code, a smaller total budget, *and*
  half the batch size, so its 0.71pp is the **least** trustworthy of the three, not the most.

**Not fixed, deliberately.** The step-3b retrain changes the epoch ceiling; changing sequence
length in the same run would confound the very comparison it exists to clean up. Options, once
3b lands:

| Option | Cost | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Disclose in Limitations, keep the runs | none | honest; reframes GCB/UniXcoder rows as a budget-allocation question |
| Set GCB text-only to 384 and retrain | 1 run | CodeBERT and GCB share one convention; also re-opens D2. *(Corrected 2026-09-04: this row previously said "Table 3's seeds ran at 512" — they ran at 384. See §3.3a.)* |
| Make all three uniform | several runs | requires retraining DFG arms too |

### Outcome of the retrain — 2026-08-12

All four ran. **Early stopping fired in every one**, so for the first time the protocol operated
as described rather than as a fixed budget.

| Run | Best epoch | Stopped | Validation trajectory (%) |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| `codebert-train-text` | 4 | early @6 | 86.88 → 87.77 → 88.07 → **88.43** → 88.38 → 88.27 |
| `codebert-final-dfg` | 5 | early @7 | 86.80 → 87.90 → 88.34 → 88.35 → **88.71** → 88.67 → 88.46 |
| `graphcodebert-train-text-only` | 4 | early @6 | 86.45 → 87.39 → 88.84 → **89.19** → 89.04 → 88.86 |
| `graphcodebert-train-dfg` | 5 | early @7 | 85.31 → 87.22 → 88.15 → 88.32 → **88.45** → 88.35 → 88.27 |

Every one peaked at epoch 4 or 5 and then declined for two consecutive epochs — so **5 was
genuinely too low a ceiling for the two text arms, and 10 is comfortably high enough for all
four.** No run came near the wall-clock guard.

What moved, against the superseded 5-epoch figures:

| Run | Before | After | Δ |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CodeBERT text | 88.2476% | 88.4177% | +0.170 |
| CodeBERT + DFG | 88.5527% | 88.3127% | −0.240 |
| GCB text | 88.9300% | 89.2300% | +0.300 |
| GCB + DFG | 88.5600% | 88.6600% | +0.100 |

The two text arms gained, as predicted. **CodeBERT+DFG lost 0.24pp despite a higher best
validation accuracy (88.71% against 88.32%)** — a validation/test divergence worth a sentence in
Limitations, not a defect.

### ⚠️ Finding 5 — effective batch size is not uniform either (2026-08-12, UNRESOLVED → D7)

Read from the `Args` blocks and confirmed in the GCB+DFG run log, which prints
`Gradient accumulation steps = 2 / Effective batch size = 32`:

| Pair | text arm | DFG arm | Matched? |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CodeBERT | 16 × 1 = **16** | 16 × 1 = **16** | ✅ |
| GraphCodeBERT | 16 × 1 = **16** | 16 × **2** = **32** | ❌ |
| UniXcoder | 16 × 1 = **16** | 8 × 2 = **16** | ✅ |

UniXcoder's micro-batch differs but its *effective* batch matches — that is a memory workaround,
not a protocol difference. GraphCodeBERT's does not: its DFG arm optimises at twice the effective
batch of its text arm. **GraphCodeBERT is simultaneously the pair with the largest DFG gap
(+0.570%) and the only pair with a mismatched effective batch size** — the same pattern as the
epoch ceiling and the eval precision before it, where the confound sat on the row doing the most
work. Closing it costs one GPU run (**D7**).

### Decision (2026-08-04): raise the ceiling and retrain

The two bolded runs are retrained so early stopping, not the cap, decides when training stops.
Both are **text-only arms**, which cuts differently per backbone:

- **GraphCodeBERT** — the protocol already favoured the DFG arm (10 / 3 against 5 / 2) and DFG
  still lost by 0.37pp. Giving text its fair ceiling can only widen that gap. The null-DFG
  conclusion is safe here and probably strengthened. **This is a good fact to hold for a
  reviewer**: the one backbone where the budget was asymmetric, it was asymmetric in DFG's
  favour and DFG still lost.
- **CodeBERT** — both arms shared the 5 / 2 cap, but only text was still climbing, and text is
  the arm that lost. This is the one place in the study where the cap could be manufacturing the
  result, and it is the row a reviewer will go after.

**D1 — open**: raising the ceiling *only* where it was hit is **data-dependent stopping**; extra
budget goes exactly to the models that benefit. Defensible if stated plainly. The cleaner
protocol is a common 10 / 3 budget across all six, letting early stopping genuinely decide —
4 more GPU runs (6 total rather than 2). **The paper must describe one protocol, uniformly
applied.** Settle before writing Section 3.

**D2 — decided 2026-09-04: re-run.** See §3.3a. The old notebooks are superseded by
`test_scripts/test_3_multiseed/`, which cold-starts from `microsoft/graphcodebert-base`, trains
at 10 / 2, and scores the filtered 18,541. One notebook per seed, three sessions pending.

## 4.4 Historical note

An earlier version used a fixed 3-epoch schedule with **no validation set**, selecting the
checkpoint on the same 10% partition later reported as test — circular evaluation. That produced
92.02%; the honest figure under held-out evaluation was 88.71%. The 3.31pp gap was entirely
optimism bias. Do not cite 92.02% anywhere.

---

# Part 5 — Data integrity

Four problems were found. Three required fixes; one is a disclosure.

## 5.1 Problem 1 — CodeBERT trained on a different split ✅ FIXED

Three incompatible 82/8/10 partitions coexisted, all seed 42:

| Partition | Built by | Was used by |
|---|---|---|
| **N** | `stratified_three_way_split`, `random.Random(42)`; `infer_source` finds nothing → one group → plain shuffle | GCB ×2, UniXcoder ×2, tests 2, 3, 5, 8 |
| **S** | same function **plus a filename-prefix fallback** → 4 real groups | tests 4, 6, 7 |
| **B** | `sklearn.train_test_split(random_state=42, stratify=…)` | CodeBERT ×2 only |

Two independent 10% subsets of one corpus overlap in ~10% of members — so ~90% of one method's
test set sits in the other's training set. When a grader on N evaluated a CodeBERT checkpoint
trained on B, it was largely asking about training data.

**Measured:**

| Model | own notebook | graded on N |
|---|---:|---:|
| UniXcoder text | 89.0778% | 89.0778% (exact — same partition) |
| CodeBERT text | 88.5627% | **93.3987%** |
| CodeBERT+DFG | 88.5427% | **93.1186%** |

A fixed checkpoint does not gain five points between two gradings. Nothing in the repo's history
produces 93% honestly (old-methodology CodeBERT was 88.4777%), so leakage is the only
explanation.

**Fixed** by retraining both CodeBERT variants on Partition N (2026-08-04); the executed
notebooks with their outputs are `training_notebooks/re_train/codebert-{train-text,final-dfg}.ipynb`.
Re-grading the old checkpoints was not an option — they were trained on B, which overlaps N's
test set, so no honest test partition remained for them.

## 5.2 Problem 2 — Tests 4, 6, 7 built Partition S ✅ FIXED IN CODE, RE-RUNS PENDING

```
test_S overlapping the true test set :  2,018  (10.09%)
test_S sitting in TRAINING           : 16,427  (82.15%)   <- leaked
test_S sitting in VALIDATION         :  1,551  ( 7.76%)
                                        -> 89.91% previously seen
```

The filename-prefix fallback has been stripped from all three. Tests 2, 3, 5 were verified clean
independently — rebuilding their test set gives **symmetric difference = 0** against the notebook
test set.

## 5.3 Problem 3 — Test-set duplication 📢 DISCLOSE

**1,455 of 19,996 test entries (7.28%) are byte-identical to a train or validation sample.**

| Source | test | clean | dropped | % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LVDAndro | 7,483 | 7,482 | 1 | 0.0% |
| Draper | 7,626 | 6,856 | 770 | 10.1% |
| Juliet | 2,489 | 1,815 | 674 | 27.1% |
| Devign | 2,398 | 2,388 | 10 | 0.4% |
| **Total** | **19,996** | **18,541** | **1,455** | **7.28%** |

> **Use 1,455 / 7.28% / 18,541, not 1,375 / 6.88%.** The audit's 1,375 counted overlap with
> *training* only. The filter also removes overlap with *validation* — correct, because
> validation drove checkpoint selection, so those samples are not clean either.

**LVDAndro, on which every Android claim rests, is unaffected at 0.01%.** 51 code bodies carry
contradictory labels (102 entries); all are Devign.

> ### ✅ Near-duplicates checked too, 2026-09-02
>
> Byte-identity is a weak test — reindenting a function defeats it. Re-running the check with all

**Both causes are confirmed in `dataset_creation_scripts/`; no dedupe step exists anywhere in
that pipeline.** Draft disclosure paragraph:

> "7.3% of test samples were byte-identical to a training or validation sample and are excluded
> from all reported metrics. Two corpus-construction artifacts account for them: Draper
> functions carrying multiple CWE labels were emitted once per CWE and the distinguishing
> `CWE_ID` field was dropped at the merge step (`finalizedataset.py`), collapsing them into

> test scaffolding containing no vulnerability logic — were captured by a `startswith('good')`
> rule in `julietprocess.py` (7,016 copies, 5,851 label=0; the largest single group is 813
> identical copies). LVDAndro, on which all Android claims rest, is unaffected at 0.01%. The 51
> code bodies carrying contradictory labels are all Devign."

## 5.4 Deduplication decisions

- **Training data: NOT deduplicated.** It would change the partition and cost 9 GPU runs
  instead of 2, and it cancels out of a within-backbone difference anyway.
- **Test set: deduplicated at evaluation time.** Costs nothing, removes the memorisation
  component from every metric, and yields Juliet's real accuracy on 1,815 unseen samples rather
  than 100% on a memorised 2,489. Implemented in `test_scripts/split_and_filter.py`.
- **Released artifact: ship the deduplicated corpus.** Contribution 2 *is* the corpus, so
  releasing it with a known duplication bug undercuts it.
  `dataset/dataset_graphcodebert_dedup.jsonl` (189,938 entries) is generated and verified.
  State plainly: *"the released corpus is deduplicated; models here were trained on the
  pre-deduplication version and evaluated on a deduplicated test partition."*
- **Original dataset untouched** — `dataset_graphcodebert.jsonl` still carries its
  Dec 28 2025 timestamp.

Dedup report:

| Source | before | after | removed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| LVDAndro | 75,000 | 74,994 | 6 |
| Draper | 75,000 | 70,740 | 4,260 |
| Juliet | 25,000 | 19,346 | 5,654 |
| Devign | 24,960 | 24,858 | 102 |
| **Total** | **199,960** | **189,938** | **10,022** |

Class ratio 50.0/50.0 before, 50.1/49.9 after. Juliet's internal balance shifts (its safe class
was the most duplicated) — **report Juliet separately from headline metrics.**

**D4 — open**: is Table 1 the unfiltered 19,996 or the filtered 18,541? The training notebooks
produce the former; the eval scripts produce the latter. They will disagree by roughly 0.5–1pp.
Pick one and apply it to Tables 1–5 uniformly.

## 5.5 test-6 model change, and the scanner inconsistency

`test-6` now evaluates **UniXcoder text-only** (89.0778%, best in Table 1); the **ensemble has
been removed**. Rationale: GCB+DFG is the weaker variant of the middle backbone, so using it for
the deployment table contradicts the paper's own null-DFG finding. The ensemble was a plain
50/50 probability average of GCB+DFG and CodeBERT text — never defined in any document despite
being reported in three of them, and built on the leaked CodeBERT besides.

> ### ✅ D3 retired — the scanner was never on GraphCodeBERT+DFG
>
> **Verified 2026-08-12 by reading `test_scripts/scanner-pipeline.ipynb` directly:**
>
> ```
> MODEL_PATH = .../graphcodebert-train-text-only/saved_models/best_model_text_only.bin

>
> The notebook also contains **no DFG code whatsoever** — no `data_flow_length`, `attn_mask`,

>
> Every prior document — including earlier revisions of this one — claimed the scanner deployed

>
> **The finding that matters, and still holds:** the scanner has never been a DFG model, so the
> deployment story never contradicted the null-DFG result. That was the substance of D3 and it is
> unaffected by anything since.
>
> **What has changed since (2026-08-31).** The scanner now instantiates **UniXcoder text-only**
> (§5.6), so two claims in the original retirement note no longer hold: it is not loading
> GraphCodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT text-only is not "the best model" — on the duplicate-filtered
> set UniXcoder leads 88.3447% to 88.2692%, a margin inside the seed-noise floor, and §3.1
> identifies no best model at all. The 89.2300% quoted here was the unfiltered figure.
>
> **D8 also came out of this** — the scanner ran at 0.45 while test-6, test-9 and §6.7 all used
> 0.60 — and is settled on 0.45 throughout (§6.7).
### 5.6 Which model each experiment uses (revised 2026-09-01)

**The scanner is a demonstration of the pipeline, not a claim about a model.** Contribution 1 is
the extraction-and-inference machinery; the classifier is a component plugged into it. That makes
the consistency requirement much narrower than an earlier revision of this section assumed.

**The binding constraint**: `test-6`, the **scanner** and `test-9` form one story — the operating
point, the sweep that justifies it, and the behaviour on real APKs. They must agree on the model,
or the threshold is calibrated on one and deployed on another. Everything else answers corpus
questions rather than deployment ones and need not match.

| Experiment | What it claims | Model | Must match the scanner? |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| test-2 | six-model comparison | all six | no |
| test-3 | training stability | GCB text-only | no |
| test-4 | per-source capability | GCB text-only | no |
| **test-6** | deployment threshold | **UniXcoder text-only** | **yes** ✅ |
| test-7 | *why DFG fails* | GCB+DFG | no — needs a DFG model by design |
| **scanner + test-9** | pipeline demonstration | **UniXcoder text-only** | — ✅ |

**test-7 stays on a DFG model deliberately.** Its job is to explain why DFG fails, so the
text-only model's mistakes would evidence nothing about DFG.

**An earlier revision over-constrained this.** It treated the scanner as designating "the system
model" and concluded that test-3 and test-4 had to follow it — implying ~18 GPU hours of
multi-seed retraining. That does not follow. The paper identifies no best model (§3.1) and the
pipeline is agnostic to the classifier, so only the deployment trio needs to agree.

> **Sequence-length trap.** GraphCodeBERT text-only trains at `code_length = 512`; every other
> text-only run uses 384. Any script evaluating it **must** use 512 or it scores the model at a
> length it never saw. This is the same asymmetry recorded as finding 4 / D5, now with an
> operational consequence.

### ⚠️ D8 — the deployed threshold is 0.45, not 0.60

| Where | Threshold |
|---|:---:|
| `scanner-pipeline.ipynb` (**what actually ships**) | **0.45** |
| `test-6-imbalanced-eval.py` (`OPT_THRESHOLD`) | 0.60 |
| `test_9_scanner_calibration.py` | 0.60 |
| §6.7's defence paragraph | 0.60 |

Two consequences. **Every reported flag rate is computed at 0.60 while the deployed scanner
alerts at 0.45**, so §3.7's per-APK rates understate what the shipped system actually surfaces.
And §6.7 defends a number the system does not use.

Align one way or the other before writing Sections 5 and 7. test-6 now writes a full threshold
sweep, so whichever value is chosen can be justified from data — but it must be re-derived on
GraphCodeBERT text-only, since the original 0.60 claim was attributed to GCB+DFG.

# Part 6 — Reviewer defences

Use these paragraphs directly. Numbers inside them are current as of 2026-08-04 unless flagged.

## 6.1 The null result as a contribution

*Attack*: "A negative result is not publishable — you failed to show DFG helps."

> "Our controlled empirical study reveals that DFG-aware attention provides no consistent
> benefit over standard transformer encoding on decompiled Android bytecode — a null result that
> is itself a contribution. Prior work demonstrating DFG's utility operated on clean,
> source-level code with meaningful identifier names. We provide the first systematic evaluation
> of DFG attention on *decompiled* code across three leading transformer backbones. We find that
> because JADX replaces identifiers with machine-generated tokens (`class_336`, `method_1192`),
> DFG edges connect semantically empty tokens; the graph is structurally present but
> informationally empty. Our qualitative analysis of the most confident false negatives confirms
> this mechanism empirically. The finding is actionable: it shows that graph-augmented
> vulnerability detection fails post-decompilation, saving the community compute and directing
> future work toward identifier reconstruction or alternative structural representations."

> ✅ **Settled 2026-09-02: the number is 1,054.** Earlier drafts cited "1,184"; an intermediate
> note here guessed the run had used UniXcoder+DFG at 1,125. Both are wrong. The clean test-7 run
> used **GraphCodeBERT+DFG**, whose FN count is **1,054**, matching Table 1 for the same model.

## 6.2 Cross-backbone inconsistency

*Attack*: "DFG helps one of your backbones — your null claim is wrong."

> ⚠️ **Rewrite required.** The previous paragraph asserted DFG harms all three backbones
> (−0.02%, −0.37%, −0.71%). After the Partition-N retrain, CodeBERT reverses to **+0.31% in
> DFG's favour**. The attack this section anticipates is now the actual situation. Rewrite after
> step 3b around this shape:

> "Across three encoder backbones, DFG augmentation fails to produce a consistent directional
> effect: it slightly favours CodeBERT, and harms GraphCodeBERT (−0.37%) and UniXcoder (−0.71%).
> A genuine structural advantage would produce consistent gains across all backbones. Instead
> the sign of the effect depends on the backbone, and every magnitude is comparable to the
> ±0.10% variation we measure across random seeds. Notably, in the one backbone where the
> training budget was asymmetric it favoured the DFG arm — GraphCodeBERT+DFG received a 10-epoch
> ceiling against text-only's 5 — and DFG still lost."

## 6.3 No SOTA comparison

*Attack*: "Why no comparison to LineVul, VulBERTa, or ReGVD?"

> "LineVul, VulBERTa and ReGVD were not available as reproducible fine-tunable checkpoints at
> the time of this study. Rather than approximating their performance through reimplementation —
> which introduces confounding implementation differences — we provide a principled
> cross-architecture comparison evaluating DFG-aware attention on three encoder backbones under
> identical training conditions. This answers a more precise question: does graph structure help
> on this data type, independent of which backbone is used?"

## 6.4 Training protocol

*Attack*: "Why did some models train for 4 epochs and others 5? Unfair comparison."

> ✅ **Written 2026-09-04, now that D1 is settled.** *The previous paragraph claimed the protocol
> lets each model "train until it reaches its true capability upper bound" — unsupported, because
> early stopping never fired in any 5-epoch run. Replaced by the following, which describes what
> the runs behind Tables 1–2 actually did.*

> "All models train under early stopping on validation accuracy with patience 2, retaining the
> best checkpoint. An audit of the initial runs found that this protocol had not in fact been
> exercised: every run at a 5-epoch ceiling terminated on the ceiling rather than on exhausted
> patience, and two — CodeBERT text-only and GraphCodeBERT text-only — selected their best
> checkpoint on the final epoch with validation accuracy still rising. Those runs were therefore
> undertrained, and we retrained all four CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT models at a 10-epoch ceiling.
> Early stopping fired in every one, each peaking at epoch 4 or 5 and then declining for two
> consecutive epochs, confirming that 10 epochs is not a binding constraint. The two UniXcoder
> models retain a 5-epoch ceiling: both peaked at epoch 4, so the ceiling did not truncate them,
> and both arms of that backbone share it, leaving the within-backbone comparison unaffected.
> Reported accuracies are from the retrained models throughout."

> **Why the honest version is the stronger one.** The retrain moved both undertrained text arms
> *up* — CodeBERT text **+0.170pp** and GCB text **+0.300pp** against their 5-epoch figures (§4.3).
> The text arms are the DFG arms' comparators, so raising them makes the DFG deltas *harder* to
> obtain, not easier. Disclosing that we found the flaw ourselves, and that fixing it worked
> against our own result, is a stronger position than defending a protocol that was not running as
> described.

## 6.5 Dataset construction

*Attack*: "Why fractional sampling? Are you cherry-picking?"

> "Each source dataset was sampled rather than used in its entirety to enforce a strict 1:1
> safe-to-vulnerable ratio. Vulnerability datasets suffer severe class imbalance — Draper
> contains substantially more samples than Devign, and LVDAndro's malicious fraction varies by
> APK source. Using full datasets without rebalancing would cause the model to learn statistical
> priors (predict 'safe' by default) rather than semantic vulnerability patterns."

## 6.6 The LVDAndro–Devign gap

*Attack*: "Devign at 68.91% shows your model doesn't generalise."

> "The gap between LVDAndro and Devign reflects a documented scope boundary. The model is
> designed as an Android vulnerability scanner, and its accuracy on decompiled Android Java
> confirms fitness for that purpose. Devign's Linux kernel C presents three compounding
> challenges: kernel idioms are underrepresented in training; kernel functions routinely exceed
> the 384-token context window — we observed sequences up to 2,543 tokens; and Devign
> vulnerabilities are predominantly inter-procedural. We report this gap transparently and do
> not generalise Android-domain claims to kernel C analysis."

> ✅ **Numbers available 2026-08-20** (§3.5, GraphCodeBERT text-only, filtered): LVDAndro
> **97.5408%**, Devign **64.7404%** — a 32.8pp gap, *wider* than the 28.2pp the contaminated table
> showed. Draper sits between at 84.0140%. Older drafts citing LVDAndro at 98.34% or 97.07% are
> superseded.
>
> ⚠️ **Weakened by §3.5b (2026-09-02).** The rebuttal above attributes the whole gap to domain
> scope. That is no longer defensible: a single `Log.x()` regex scores 82.95% on the LVDAndro side
> and there is no comparable shortcut on the Devign side, so part of the 32.8pp is shortcut
> availability rather than domain difficulty. The kernel-C arguments (token window, inter-procedural
> vulnerabilities, underrepresentation) still stand on their own and should carry this defence;
> the sentence "its accuracy on decompiled Android Java confirms fitness for that purpose" must be
> dropped, because §3.5b shows that accuracy does not establish fitness.

## 6.7 Threshold 0.45 ✅ SETTLED

*Attack*: "Why 0.45? And why not the threshold that maximises F1?"

**The sweep** — UniXcoder text-only, the configuration the scanner runs, on the
duplicate-filtered 18,541 set under a 90/10 imbalance (2026-09-01):

| Threshold | Precision | Recall | F1 | FPR | FN |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0.30 | 0.4512 | 90.51% | 0.6022 | 12.23% | 99 |
| **0.45** ← **deployed** | 0.4798 | **88.59%** | 0.6224 | 10.67% | **119** |
| 0.60 | 0.5168 | 87.15% | 0.6488 | 9.05% | 134 |

| 0.99 | 0.8885 | 55.80% | 0.6855 | 0.78% | 461 |

Rows beyond 0.95 were computed from the saved probabilities
(`results/predictions/test6_probs_imbalanced.npy`) rather than a second GPU run, and confirm 0.95
is a genuine interior maximum rather than a truncation artifact.

**Paragraph for Section 5**:

**Disclose the cost plainly.** Precision at 0.45 is **0.4798** — slightly under half of what the
scanner flags is a false alarm. Earlier drafts called this "a high-precision triage filter"; the
numbers have never supported that phrase and it must not appear.

> ### What this replaces
>
> Every prior draft claimed *"threshold sensitivity analysis reveals F1 is maximised at 0.60,
> achieving 83.4% recall at a 7.8% false positive rate."* Its figures appeared in no results file;
> 0.60 is not the F1 maximum for either model; and the sweep it cited stopped at 0.65 with F1 still
> rising, so it could not have located a maximum at all.
>
> An intermediate version of this section quoted the **GraphCodeBERT** sweep — F1 peak 0.90,
> 88.21% recall, 10.32% FPR, precision 0.4870. Those are superseded: with the scanner instantiated
> on UniXcoder text-only, the sweep must describe the model actually deployed.

## 6.8 The sliding window ❌ **RETRACTED 2026-09-02 — the deployed scanner truncates**

*Attack*: "Functions exceeding 384 tokens are truncated."

> ❌ **The answer is: yes, they are.** The defence below describes
> `training_notebooks/old_train/scanner-pipeline-final.ipynb`, which is the **only** file in the
> repo containing `stride = code_length // 2`. The shipped scanner
> (`test_scripts/scanner-pipeline.ipynb`) calls the tokenizer with
> `max_length=384, truncation=True` and has no windowing at all. Verified by reading
> `infer_vulnerability` and `infer_vulnerabilities_batched` directly.
>
> The `results[m_id] = max(results.get(m_id, 0.0), p_vuln)` line looks like chunk aggregation but
> is **dead code**: `all_methods.append((m_id_counter, m['code'], [], short_class))` increments
> the counter per method, so every `m_id` is unique and the `max` never combines anything.
> Note that call also passes the DFG slot as `[]` — the scanner is text-only by construction.
>
> **Every number in §3.7 and Test 9 was produced under truncation, not windowing.** Do not cite
> the paragraph below; it describes capability the measured system does not have.

*Superseded text, retained for provenance:*

> "For functions exceeding 384 tokens the pipeline generates overlapping chunks (stride =
> code_length / 2), processes each independently, and takes the maximum vulnerability
> probability across chunks as the function-level score. This ensures signals in the tail of
> long functions are evaluated rather than silently discarded. For extremely long functions —
> up to 2,543 tokens in Devign kernel code — the sliding window cannot fully resolve inter-chunk
> dependencies."

## 6.9 Cross-language fusion (Java + C/C++)

*Attack*: "Java and C++ have different vulnerability classes."

> "Modern Android applications routinely use JNI to call compiled C++ shared libraries. An
> Android security scanner processing only Java misses the native attack surface. By training on
> both Java (LVDAndro, Juliet) and C/C++ (Draper, Devign) patterns, the model acquires
> cross-language knowledge reflecting the hybrid reality of production APKs. Per-source
> evaluation confirms this does not harm Java performance."

> ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-09-02.** The original read "C/C++ (Draper, Devign, Juliet)". Juliet is 99.8%
> Java (§4.1), so it belongs on the other side of that sentence. The argument is unaffected — the
> corpus does span both languages — but the attribution was wrong.

## 6.10 The InsecureShop result

*Attack*: "InsecureShop is intentionally vulnerable but flags fewer functions than your clean
apps. Your scanner doesn't work."

> "InsecureShop — a deliberately vulnerable Android training application — yields a lower
> vulnerable-function rate (3.6%) than the clean AntennaPod application (7.2%). This reflects
> the training distribution boundary: InsecureShop's intentional vulnerabilities include
> hardcoded credentials, SQL injection and insecure SharedPreferences — textbook patterns that
> may be expressed differently at the decompiled bytecode level than the CVE-labelled patterns
> on which the model was trained. More broadly, app-level flag rates do not separate vulnerable
> from clean applications in our sample (§3.7): the system is a function-level triage signal and
> we make no app-level claim."

> ✅ **Updated 2026-09-01** to the deployed configuration: **3.6% vs 7.2%**. Older drafts cite
> 4.8% vs 8.4%, then 3.0% vs 9.3%; both predate the current scanner. The inversion persists across
> every configuration measured, so it is a real property of the system and the paragraph owns it
> rather than minimising it.

## 6.11 Static over dynamic analysis

*Attack*: "Dynamic analysis is more accurate."

> "While dynamic analysis can resolve runtime-dependent vulnerability conditions, it lacks
> scalability for arbitrary APK analysis. Executing an unknown APK requires a full Android
> runtime, JNI bridge mocking, interaction simulation and significant compute per APK. Static
> analysis via our decompilation pipeline processes an entire APK's developer logic in minutes
> on a single GPU. We frame the system explicitly as a triage filter: it surfaces functions
> warranting analyst attention, not definitive verdicts."

## 6.12 Juliet at 100%

*Attack*: "100% on Juliet inflates your metrics."

> ⚠️ **Rewritten 2026-08-20.** The previous paragraph implied duplication was doing the work.
> It is not: after removing the 674 duplicated samples (27.1%), Juliet scores **100.0000% on 1,815
> samples it never saw, with zero false negatives** (§3.5). Attributing it to memorisation would be
> a claim the data contradicts, and a reviewer who reruns it would catch that.

> "Juliet Test Suite samples are reported separately and excluded from all capability claims.
> After removing the 27.1% of Juliet's test partition that was byte-identical to a training sample,
> the remaining 1,815 unseen samples are still classified with perfect accuracy. This is not
> memorisation: synthetic CWE test cases are generated from a small set of templates, so a model
> that has learned the template generalises to unseen instances of it trivially. Juliet therefore
> measures template recognition rather than vulnerability detection, and we report it only as a
> sanity check that the pipeline is wired correctly. All capability claims reference LVDAndro —
> real decompiled Android code, 97.54% — and Draper."

# Part 7 — Qualitative analysis (Section 8 material)

> ✅ **Re-derived 2026-09-02 from the clean run.** test-7 was re-run on the duplicate-filtered

> **1,054 false negatives**), but this Part was not rewritten against it until now, because

> copying numbers across. That is done; §7.1 below is the new distribution and supersedes the
> Partition-S 5/4/3/3/2/1/1/1 table entirely.
>
> **Cross-check**: test-7's 1,054 FNs for GCB+DFG match Table 1's FN column for the same model

>

> non-Android case in §7.7, neither of which existed in the old analysis.

## 7.1 Distribution ✅ re-derived 2026-09-02

GraphCodeBERT+DFG, filtered partition, 20 most confident false negatives (99.97–99.99% confidence
of safety). Hand-classified; several samples show more than one pattern and are assigned their
dominant one.

| Pattern | Description | top-20 | Source |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| P1 | structural fragmentation | 5 | LVDAndro |
| P5a | machine-generated identifiers | 5 | LVDAndro |
| P2 | benign surface, no vulnerability logic | 3 | LVDAndro ×2, Draper |
| P4 | Android API semantic bypass | 2 | LVDAndro |
| P3 | arithmetic edge case | 2 | Draper |
| **P5c** | **compiler-generated identifiers in C** | **1** | **Draper** |
| P6 | control-flow / comparison logic | 1 | Draper |
| P7 | inter-procedural access | 1 | LVDAndro |

**P5a + P1 = 10/20**, and 12 of the 15 LVDAndro cases show fragmentation, so identifier loss and
malformed structure together account for the bulk of confident failures.

**P5b is gone.** No Kotlin/lambda case appears in the clean top-20. The old table's 3 were
Partition-S samples. Keep L2.2 as a limitation, but **do not cite a P5b count.**

**P5c is new** and is the most useful single sample in the set — see §7.7.

## 7.1a The confidence asymmetry — the strongest evidence for the mechanism

Source distribution differs sharply between *all* false negatives and the *most confident* ones:

| Source | all 1,054 FNs | top-20 most confident |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Draper | 618 (58.6%) | 5 (25%) |
| Devign | 365 (34.6%) | 0 |
| **LVDAndro** | **71 (6.7%)** | **15 (75%)** |
| Juliet | 0 | 0 |

**LVDAndro supplies 6.7% of the errors and 75% of the errors made with near-total certainty** — an
elevenfold overrepresentation. The model is rarely wrong on decompiled Android code, and when it is
wrong there it is wrong with more confidence than anywhere else in the corpus. A model still
drawing signal from the graph would hedge on inputs whose graphs are uninformative; this one calls
them unambiguously safe.

## 7.2 P5a — Full machine-generated identifier obfuscation

> "The dominant failure mode is complete identifier obfuscation (P5a). JADX strips all symbolic
> information when the APK was compiled with ProGuard or R8: classes become `class_336`, methods
> `method_1192`, fields `field_1000`, local variables generic numeric indices (`n21`, `n22`).
> The DFG edges built over these tokens are syntactically valid — the parser correctly
> identifies data flows between definitions and uses — but semantically empty. When every node
> carries a machine-generated token, the attention mechanism has no basis for distinguishing a
> vulnerable data flow from a benign one. The model assigns 99.99% confidence of safety,
> reflecting not uncertainty but the complete absence of discriminative signal. This provides
> the mechanistic explanation for the null ablation result: under full obfuscation, DFG-aware
> attention reduces to standard attention over a graph of meaningless connections."

## 7.3 P5b — Kotlin/lambda synthetic obfuscation ⚠️ **no longer evidenced**

> ⚠️ **No Kotlin/lambda case appears in the clean top-20** (§7.1). The three that did were
> Partition-S samples. The phenomenon is real and stays as limitation L2.2, but the paragraph below
> is now an unevidenced claim about the corpus rather than a finding about the model's failures.
> **Do not cite it as part of the qualitative analysis** unless a Kotlin case is found in a
> re-derived list.

> "A Kotlin-specific variant (P5b) accounts for a further set of false negatives. The Kotlin
> compiler generates synthetic class names for lambda expressions (e.g.
> `-$$Lambda$Sounds$iJSOl-pseCunlcJXFFxU9chQx24`) and coroutine state machines (e.g.
> `MediaParsingService$updateStorages$2`) that are non-semantic by design. Beyond obfuscated
> names, Kotlin-decompiled code produces distinctive patterns — coroutine continuation passing,
> `Intrinsics.checkExpressionValueIsNotNull` calls, `CollectionsKt`/`StringsKt` wrapper
> invocations — that differ structurally from the Java-centric LVDAndro training samples,
> creating an additional distributional gap."

## 7.4 P1 — Structural fragmentation ⚠️ **cause re-attributed 2026-09-02**

> "Structural fragmentation (P1) arises because JADX occasionally produces syntactically
> impossible Java: `package` declarations inside method bodies, `import` statements after
> executable code, field declarations interleaved with method invocations. The dataset pipeline
> wraps each snippet in a `DummyClass` container, but this cannot repair an interior that
> violates Java grammar. Tree-sitter parses these fragments with best-effort recovery, producing
> ASTs and DFGs that correspond to no semantically coherent program. The model's 99.9%+ safe
> confidence reflects that no valid Java program would ever look like this — the structural
> impossibility itself signals 'not malicious' to a model trained primarily on syntactically
> valid code."

> ### ⚠️ The behavioural claim survives; the causal attribution does not
>
> The §3.5b audit forces a correction here. **The paragraph above blames JADX. The dominant cause
> is our own windowing.** Measured over test-7's 1,054 false negatives:
>
> | Source | FNs | not brace-balanced |
> |---|:---:|:---:|
> | **LVDAndro** | 71 | **63 (88.7%)** |
> | Draper | 618 | 8 (1.3%) |
> | Devign | 365 | 4 (1.1%) |
>
> and **13 of the 20 most-confident false negatives are brace-unbalanced**, 13 of the 15 LVDAndro
> ones. So P1 is real, sharply concentrated, and the model's reaction to it is exactly as
> described — malformed input reads as "not a program," and the model returns 99.9%+ safe.
>
> What changes is what P1 is *evidence of*. Only LVDAndro records are affected, and §3.5b shows
> their malformation comes from a ±5-row window taken over LVDAndro's per-line CSV rather than
> over consecutive source lines. **P1 therefore describes a defect in our corpus construction, not
> a property of JADX output or of decompiled Android code.** Written up as-is it would tell
> readers something false about decompilers.
>
> For the manuscript: keep the behavioural observation (models trained on valid code assign high
> safe-confidence to input that violates the grammar — that is a genuine and useful finding about
> robustness), and drop the JADX attribution. If D9 is resolved by rebuilding the corpus, P1
> should be re-derived afterwards; its 5 instances would likely shrink substantially.

## 7.5 P7 — Inter-procedural access patterns

> "Inter-procedural access patterns (P7) represent a fundamental architectural limitation. In
> one case the vulnerable code directly accesses credential fields (`userId`, `token`) from a
> parent Activity through a class cast; whether this constitutes a vulnerability depends
> entirely on the calling context — who invokes the method, under what conditions, and whether
> access is appropriately gated. In another, the vulnerability lies in how externally-provided
> data flows through multiple method boundaries before reaching a dangerous operation.
> Single-function analysis is structurally incapable of detecting these patterns: the evidence
> is distributed across the call graph."

## 7.6 P2, P3, P6, P4 — the remaining patterns

> **P2 (benign surface)**: "One case implements a synchronized random number generator with
> clean, idiomatic structure; the vulnerability is a threading race where the synchronized block
> does not protect all shared state. Another implements a systematic API version check with
> structured error reporting; the vulnerability is an incomplete error-handling path that looks
> defensive. Both follow patterns likely prevalent in the safe training class."

> **P3 (arithmetic edge case)**: "An animation interpolation function containing repeated
> floating-point division guarded by identity checks. The vulnerability is a divide-by-zero when
> two distinct keyframes share a timestamp — a case the identity guard does not cover. Detecting
> it requires understanding the guard's semantics and reasoning about valid input ranges."

> **P6 (control flow / flag logic)**: "A C signal function whose bitmask expression contains a
> duplicate flag (`DjVuFile::DECODE_STOPPED` appears twice in the OR condition). The DFG
> correctly captures data flows but cannot reason about the semantics of bitmask operations or
> identify redundant flag combinations."

> **P4 (Android API semantic bypass)**: "Misuse of Android API contracts — unvalidated
> `getStringExtra` calls and hardcoded resource identifiers. Detecting this requires knowledge
> of which specific API usage patterns are dangerous, semantic knowledge that cannot be derived
> from intra-function data flow analysis alone."

## 7.7 P5c — the same mechanism outside Android ✅ **new, 2026-09-02**

One Draper sample is worth more than its single count. `Draper_731098_file` is the C function
`nokia_isi_modem_real_powerOn`, and its locals are named `_tmp0_` through `_tmp9_`:

```c
gboolean _tmp0_ = FALSE;
FsoFrameworkLogger* _tmp1_ = NULL;
NokiaIsiModemRapuType _tmp4_ = 0;
```

**These names were generated by the Vala source-to-source compiler**, not by a decompiler and not
by an obfuscator. The model misses it at **99.98% confidence of safety** — the same failure
signature as the fully obfuscated LVDAndro cases.

**Why this matters more than one sample should.** Every other piece of evidence in this Part is
Android, so a reviewer can reasonably ask whether the finding is really about JADX, or ProGuard, or
Android specifically. This sample answers that: the mechanism is about *machine-generated
identifiers*, whatever produces them. Obfuscator, decompiler, or transpiler — once the nodes carry
no semantic content, the edges over them carry no information. It generalises the claim at no cost
in scope, and it ties directly to Dramko et al.'s account of what compilation destroys (§8b.4).

## 7.8 The deployed scanner model fails the same way ✅ **new, 2026-09-02 (test-7b)**

Everything above profiles **GraphCodeBERT + DFG**. The scanner ships **UniXcoder text-only** (D6,
§5.6), so Section 8 described failures of a model we do not deploy, and the mechanism rested on a
single model's 20 samples. Test-7b closes both gaps.

`results/test7b_qualitative_scanner_results.txt` — UniXcoder text-only, the exact scanner
configuration (`microsoft/unixcoder-base`, 384 tokens, truncation, threshold 0.45), same
duplicate-filtered 18,541 partition.

| | @0.45 (deployed) | @0.50 (argmax) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Accuracy | 88.3717% | 88.3447% |
| False negatives | 1,154 | 1,217 |

The @0.50 row reproduces test-2's independently recorded 88.3447% / FN 1,217 exactly. FNs by
source at 0.45: Draper 605, Devign 457, LVDAndro 92.

### 7.8a The two architectures fail on the same samples

This is the result worth putting in the paper. Comparing the scanner model's 1,154 false negatives
against GCB+DFG's 1,054:

| | |
|---|:---:|
| shared false negatives | **750** |
| expected if independent | 132.9 |
| **enrichment** | **5.6×** |
| Jaccard | 0.514 |
| GCB+DFG FNs also missed by the scanner model | **71.2%** |

Two different backbones (GraphCodeBERT vs UniXcoder) and two different architectures (DFG-attention
vs plain text) converge on **the same 750 samples**, 5.6× more than chance. **The failures are a
property of the inputs, not of the architecture.** That is the strongest available evidence for the
mechanism this paper argues: if identifier loss is what defeats the models, every model should fail
in the same places regardless of whether it consumes a graph — and it does.

It also disposes of a reviewer question Part 7 could not previously answer: *does the mechanism hold
for the text-only arms, or only the DFG one?* It holds for both.

### 7.8b The pattern distribution reproduces on a different backbone

Top-20 most confident false negatives, scanner model vs GCB+DFG:

| | UniXcoder text-only | GraphCodeBERT + DFG |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| LVDAndro / Draper | 11 / 9 | 15 / 5 |
| not brace-balanced | 10 / 20 | 13 / 20 |
| LVDAndro cases malformed | 10 of 11 | 13 of 15 |

P1 (structural fragmentation) and P5a (machine-generated identifiers) dominate both. Draper is
more prominent for the scanner model, consistent with §7.7's P5c — the mechanism is not
Android-specific.

**The confidence asymmetry sharpens further.** Only **8.1%** of the scanner model's 1,154 false
negatives are malformed, but **50%** of its top 20 are — a **6.2× concentration** at the
high-confidence end. Malformed input does not merely cause errors; it causes *confident* errors.
That corroborates §7.1a on a second model, and is exactly what §7.4's re-attributed reading
predicts.

> **Method note — confirmed on GPU 2026-09-04.** Test-7b was first derived on CPU from

# Part 8 — Draft paper sentences

## 8.1 Introduction

> "Android malware has grown to encompass millions of applications, making automated static
> analysis at scale an urgent practical need. Data Flow Graph augmented transformers have
> demonstrated promising results for code understanding on clean source code, yet their
> applicability to decompiled Android bytecode — the only representation available for
> closed-source APKs — remains empirically untested. This paper makes three contributions: (1) we
> present the first end-to-end vulnerability scanning pipeline for arbitrary Android APKs,
> including DFG extraction from decompiled Java and Kotlin bytecode at scale; (2) we publicly
> release a 200,000-sample DFG-annotated multi-source vulnerability corpus; (3) through
> controlled ablation across three encoder backbones, we find that DFG-aware attention provides
> no consistent benefit on decompiled code, and explain this mechanistically through qualitative
> analysis of false negatives."

## 8.2 Dataset and pipeline

> "Our training corpus comprises 199,960 balanced samples drawn from four sources: LVDAndro
> (decompiled Android Java), Draper (C/C++ NVD/SARD CVEs), Devign (C/C++ QEMU/FFmpeg), and the
> Juliet Test Suite (synthetic CWEs), with a strict 1:1 safe-to-vulnerable ratio enforced across
> all sources."

> "All six transformer models are trained identically: an 82/8/10 train/val/test partition

> max norm 1.0, FP16 mixed precision, and validation-based checkpoint selection. The best
> validation checkpoint is evaluated once on the held-out test partition."

> ⚠️ The epoch budget sentence is deliberately omitted pending D1.

## 8.3 Model comparison and ablation

> "Table 1 presents the full comparison. All six transformer models cluster within a
> percentage-point accuracy band regardless of whether graph-augmented attention is applied.
> This convergence suggests the performance ceiling on decompiled Android vulnerability
> detection is determined by the data domain rather than model architecture."

> "Our controlled ablation yields no consistent directional effect from DFG augmentation across
> the three backbones; the sign of the effect depends on the backbone, and every magnitude is
> comparable to the variation measured across random seeds."

## 8.4 Limitations and qualitative analysis

> "The null DFG result is not architecturally inevitable — GraphCodeBERT's DFG attention
> demonstrably improves performance on clean source-level code. To understand why it fails on
> decompiled bytecode we analyse the most confident false negatives from our held-out test set.
> The mistakes reveal a coherent picture dominated by complete identifier obfuscation and

## 8b.1 The gap this paper fills

Stated plainly, so the section can be written toward it:

> Structure-aware code models are motivated by the unreliability of identifier names, evaluated on
> human-written source where names are merely inconsistent, and increasingly applied to
> vulnerability detection — a task none of them were originally evaluated on. Nobody has tested
> whether the mechanism survives when identifiers are not unreliable but **absent**, which is the
> condition of all decompiled code and therefore of all closed-source Android analysis.

## 8b.2 Pre-trained models of code, and the structure-aware turn

**CodeBERT** (Feng et al., Findings of EMNLP 2020) established the bimodal NL–PL recipe: a
multi-layer Transformer trained with masked language modelling plus replaced token detection,
using both bimodal NL–PL pairs and unimodal code. It was evaluated on **natural-language code
search and code documentation generation**. **GraphCodeBERT
(Guo et al., ICLR 2021)** added data flow, and its motivation is the sentence this paper is built
against:

> *"Programmers do not always follow the naming conventions so that it is hard to understand the
> semantic of the variable v only from its name. The semantic structure of code provides a way to
> understand the semantic of the variable v by leveraging dependency relation between variables."*

The design follows from that premise. Data flow is a graph of "where-the-value-comes-from"
relations between **variables**; it is injected through a graph-guided masked attention function
and two structure-aware pre-training objectives, edge prediction and node alignment, on top of
masked language modelling. Pre-training is on CodeSearchNet — 2.3M functions across six languages,
paired with natural-language documentation.

**What they demonstrated, precisely** (all verified from the paper):

| Task | GraphCodeBERT | CodeBERT | Δ |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Code search (MRR, overall) | 0.713 | 0.693 | +0.020 |
| Clone detection (F1) | 0.971 | 0.965 | +0.006 |
| Code translation Java→C# (BLEU) | 80.58 | 79.92 | +0.66 |
| Code refinement, small (BLEU) | 80.02 | 77.42 | +2.60 |

Their own ablation removes data flow entirely and drops code search from **0.713 to 0.693 MRR**,
which is the cleanest published measurement of what the DFG mechanism is worth: about two MRR
points, on clean source. They further report that although DFG nodes are only 5–20% of the input,
the `[CLS]` token directs **10–32% of its attention** to them — evidence, they argue, that the
model genuinely prefers structural signal.

**Two facts about that evidence matter for us.** First, every task above is code search, clone
detection, translation or refinement — **GraphCodeBERT was never evaluated on vulnerability
detection.** Applying it there, as this paper and much recent work does, is already an
extrapolation. Second, all of it is CodeSearchNet: human-written source with meaningful, if
inconsistent, identifiers.

**UniXcoder** (Guo et al., ACL 2022) is the third backbone, and takes a third route to structure.
It uses mask attention matrices with prefix adapters to switch between encoder, decoder and
encoder-decoder behaviour, and enriches code representation with **AST and code comments** — the
AST flattened by a one-to-one mapping into a sequence that "retains all structural information."
It is evaluated on five code-related tasks across nine datasets.

## 8b.3 Deep learning for vulnerability detection, and its reliability problem

Reported accuracies in this area reach 95%, and the field's own audits have not been kind to them.

**ReVeal (Chakraborty et al., TSE)** is the closest work in spirit to this paper. Asking *"how well
do state-of-the-art DL-based techniques perform in a real-world vulnerability prediction
scenario?"*, they find performance **drops by more than 50%**. A pre-trained model applied to
real-world vulnerabilities loses ~73% on average; even retrained on real-world data it remains
~54% below reported figures. Their headline case: VulDeePecker's reported 86.9% precision becomes
**11.12%** on real data, and 17.68% after retraining.

They attribute this to four causes, three of which this paper encounters directly:

- **Data duplication** — training and test sets overlap by *up to 68%*, "artificially inflating the
  reported results"
- **Learning irrelevant features** — models latch onto "specific variable/function names" rather
  than vulnerability semantics
- **Inadequate model** — token-based models miss semantic dependencies, and *"even when a
  graph-based model is used, it does not focus on increasing the class-separation"*
- Data imbalance

A further datapoint sits inside this literature and points the same way as our result.
**LineVul** (Fu & Tantithamthavorn, MSR 2022) is a Transformer-based line-level vulnerability
predictor evaluated on 188k+ C/C++ functions. Its comparison is against **IVDetect, a graph-based
approach** (FA-GCN with a GNN explainer), and LineVul reports **160–379% higher F1** at function
level. That is a token-based Transformer decisively outperforming a graph neural network at
vulnerability detection **on clean source code** — where, unlike our setting, the graph's nodes
still carry meaningful names. It is independent evidence that structural augmentation is not
automatically the stronger choice for this task, and it is a useful thing to cite before we make
the same argument in a harder setting.

**Allamanis (2019)** quantifies the duplication problem for code models generally: metrics are
*"inflated by up to 100% when testing on duplicated corpora"*, and performance as experienced by a
user can be *"up to 50% worse compared to reported results"*. The mechanism is that duplication
violates the i.i.d. assumption between train and test.

> **How to position our own numbers honestly.** Our corpus is **7.28%** duplicated at test time
> (§5.3) — far below ReVeal's 68% and the GitHub-mined corpora Allamanis studied — and filtering
> moved accuracy by only 0.06–0.96pp per model (§3.1). We should cite these two works as the
> reason we filtered *and* report that the effect here was small. Claiming a large duplication

> than assumed it.

ReVeal's "learning irrelevant features" finding deserves particular emphasis, because **our setting
is its limiting case**. Where they found models leaning on identifier names, decompilation removes
those names entirely. A model that had been relying on them has nothing left to rely on — and, as
we show, the data-flow graph does not fill the gap.

## 8b.4 Decompiled code and the loss of identifier semantics

That identifier names are destroyed by compilation is not our observation, and we should cite it
rather than argue it. **Dramko et al. (TOSEM 2023)**, extending DIRE (Lacomis et al., ASE 2019),
put it directly:

> *"Compilers discard source-level information and lower its level of abstraction in the interest
> of binary size, execution time, and even obfuscation. As a result, variable names, user-defined
> types, and idiomatic structure are all lost at compile time… In particular, variable names, which
> are highly important for code comprehension and readability, become nothing more than arbitrary
> placeholders such as `VAR1` and `VAR2`."*

Our `class_336` and `method_1192` are the Android form of exactly this. They also note that while
compilers *can* preserve names via debug information, **"malware authors and commercial vendors
typically set compiler flags to prevent this"** — which is why the problem is unavoidable in the
threat model we care about, not an artifact of our pipeline.

An entire family of neural renaming techniques exists to undo this — DIRE, DIRECT, DIRTY — and
their existence is the strongest external evidence for our mechanism. **If structure alone were
sufficient to recover the semantics that names carry, this line of work would not be necessary.**
Notably, Dramko et al. also cite code duplication in training data as a known threat to these
models, which connects them to Allamanis and to §5.3.

This also frames our future work. If DFG fails on decompiled code because its nodes are
semantically empty, the natural remedy is to populate them — identifier reconstruction *before*
structural modelling, rather than structural modelling as a substitute for identifiers.

## 8b.5 Android and APK-level analysis

**LVDAndro** (Senanayake et al., SECRYPT 2023, pp. 659–666) is the source of the Android half of
our corpus and the only one of our four sources that is decompiled Android code, so its
construction deserves description rather than citation.

It is built in three stages: APKs are scraped from FossDroid (33%), AndroZoo (46%) and other
repositories (21%); each is decompiled and scanned; and the resulting per-line records are
preprocessed. The published dataset is a sequence of three; **Dataset 03** (Dec-2022) is the one
in general use — 15,021 apps, 21,289,029 code samples, 14,689,432 vulnerable against 6,599,597
non-vulnerable, spanning 23 CWE-IDs.

Three properties of it matter for how our own results must be read:

**Labels are static-analyser output, not human judgement.** Vulnerability status and CWE-ID come
from running **MobSF and QARK** over the decompiled source and taking the union of their findings
— the stated aim being that "ML models trained with LVDAndro learn the capabilities of all
scanners." The authors are explicit about what that inherits: the two tools *"rely on signatures,
which are known for producing a high number of false negatives."* Any model trained on LVDAndro is
therefore learning to reproduce a signature-based scanner, and its ceiling is that scanner's
behaviour rather than ground-truth exploitability. Their own headline comparison — MobSF 91%,
QARK 89%, proposed AutoML model 94% — should be read with the same caveat, since the labels the
94% is scored against were themselves produced by the 91% and 89% tools.

**The unit is a line, not a function.** LVDAndro's schema stores `Code` ("original source code
line") and `Processed_code` ("source code line after preprocessing"). It is a line-level corpus.
Function-level use therefore requires a windowing step, which is where §3.5b's problem enters.

**Preprocessing normalises away lexical content.** User-defined string values are replaced with
`user_str`, and all comments with `//user_comment`. We ingest the raw `Code` field rather than
`Processed_code`, so we do not inherit this — verified: 0 of 75,000 of our LVDAndro records
contain `user_str` and 1 contains `user_comment`. Worth stating explicitly, because a reader who
knows LVDAndro will otherwise assume our identifier-semantics argument is confounded by the
dataset's own normalisation. It is not; the anonymisation we describe is JADX's, not LVDAndro's.

**Positioning.** LVDAndro's own proof-of-concept uses AutoML over classical classifiers — RF, MLP,
SVC and similar — on TF-IDF-style features of single lines. That is a different proposition from
ours in three ways: we work at function granularity with a 384-token window rather than per line;
we fine-tune pre-trained code transformers rather than fit classical models; and our question is
comparative — whether *structural* augmentation helps — rather than whether the dataset supports
detection at all. Their contribution is the labelled resource; ours uses it as one of four sources
and does not inherit its accuracy claims. Conventional Android analysers (MobSF, QARK, AndroBugs)
sit underneath both as rule-based detectors: they are the labelling instrument here, not a
baseline we outperform, and we make no claim to beat them.

## 8b.6 What is new here

Against that background, the contributions state cleanly:

1. **The first test of DFG-aware attention on decompiled code.** GraphCodeBERT's mechanism is
   motivated by unreliable identifiers and validated where identifiers are merely inconsistent. We
   evaluate it where they are machine-generated, across three backbones under a controlled
   protocol, and find no consistent benefit (§3.2).
2. **A mechanistic account rather than a bare negative.** Data flow is defined *over variables*. When
   decompilation reduces those variables to `class_336` and `method_1192`, the graph is
   syntactically intact and semantically empty — the edges are correct and carry no information
   (Part 7).
3. **A 200k DFG-annotated corpus** spanning decompiled Android Java/Kotlin and C/C++, released
   deduplicated.
4. **An end-to-end pipeline** from APK to function-level triage, demonstrated on 13 real
   applications (§3.7).

> **Framing note.** Position this as *scope*, not contradiction. GraphCodeBERT's results on clean
> source stand; we replicate none of them and dispute none of them. The claim is narrower and
> stronger for it: the mechanism does not transfer to a domain where its precondition — that
> variables are identifiable entities carrying some signal — no longer holds.

# Part 9 — Limitations

Ordered by severity. Those marked 🔄 changed materially on 2026-08-04.

## 9.1 Training and evaluation

**L1.1 ✅ — Epoch ceiling truncated two runs; fixed 2026-08-12.** In the original runs, early
stopping never *fired* in any of the five 5-epoch runs — all terminated on `num_train_epochs`. But
only two were still improving at the cap: `codebert-train-text` and `graphcodebert-train-text-only`
selected their best checkpoint on the final epoch with validation still rising, so their reported
accuracies were floors. The other three had already peaked at epoch 4 and were declining
(patience 1/2), so the cap was not binding for them.

**All four CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT runs were retrained at 10 / 2, and early stopping fired in
every one** (§4.3). Each peaked at epoch 4 or 5 then declined for two consecutive epochs, so 10 is
comfortably clear of the wall. The figures in Tables 1–2 are the retrained ones.

**Residual, disclosed:** the two UniXcoder runs remain at **5 / 2** — verified in their `Args`
blocks. They were not retrained because neither was truncated: `unixcoder-text-only` peaked at
epoch 4 and `unixcoder-dfg-final` peaked at 4 then declined at 5. Both arms of that backbone share
the same ceiling, so the within-backbone comparison this paper makes is unaffected; what differs is
the ceiling *across* backbones (4 runs at 10 / 2, 2 at 5 / 2). *Supersedes the older "fixed 3-epoch
budget may undertrain the DFG mechanism" limitation, which described an abandoned methodology and
pointed the opposite way — under early stopping it is the text-only arms that were undertrained.*

**L1.2 — DFG built over parser-recovery wrappers.** Decompiled fragments frequently lack
enclosing class or method context required for valid Java parsing. Each is wrapped in
`public class DummyClass { public void dummyMethod() { … } }`, applied uniformly regardless of
label. The DFG therefore includes wrapper-token edges alongside real ones. For long functions
this is a small fraction; for short obfuscated fragments — disproportionately the hard cases —
it is larger. This is an engineering necessity, not a flaw: excluding incomplete fragments would
discard a large, unrepresentable fraction of real decompiled code and bias the corpus toward
easier samples. The residual question — whether wrapper edges interfere with
vulnerability-relevant ones — cannot be answered without syntactically complete inputs that do
not exist for all samples.

**L1.3 — Test-set duplication.** 7.28% of the test partition is byte-identical to a training or
validation sample; removed from all reported metrics (§5.3).

**L1.4 — Same-APK leakage is unmeasurable.** All 199,960 filenames are unique, so there is no
filename-group leakage, but APK-level provenance was not preserved during corpus construction.
Whether two functions from the same APK straddle the train/test boundary cannot be determined
without regenerating the corpus.

## 9.2 Data and preprocessing

**L2.1 — Identifier semantics stripped by decompilation.** JADX replaces class, method and field
names with machine-generated tokens under ProGuard/R8. DFG attention was designed to track
meaningful flows between named variables; when names carry no information, edges connect tokens
the model cannot interpret. This is the primary explanation for the null result — and it limits
the text-only models too.

**L2.2 — Kotlin synthetic identifiers.** Lambda compilation and coroutines produce names like
`-$$Lambda$ClassName$hashcode`, non-semantic by design and structurally different from both
clean and ProGuard-obfuscated Java. Underrepresented in training.

**L2.3 — Structural fragmentation.** JADX sometimes emits output violating Java grammar, and the
`DummyClass` wrapper cannot repair a syntactically invalid interior. **Quantified 2026-09-02
(§3.5b): only 16.7% of LVDAndro test records are brace-balanced, against 99.5% (Draper), 97.4%
(Devign) and 100% (Juliet).** The dominant cause is not JADX but our own windowing — a ±5-row
window over LVDAndro's per-line CSV concatenates lines that are not adjacent in the source file.
Earlier wording ("occasionally", "sometimes") understated this by a wide margin for the Android
portion.

**L2.4 — Fractional sampling.** Each source was sampled, not used in full, to enforce class
balance. The sampled subset may not represent the full within-source distribution; Devign in
particular was selected without stratification by vulnerability type, function length or
language subset.

**L2.5 — DFG node budget.** Capped at 128 nodes. Long, complex functions — more common in Draper
and Devign — are likelier to hit the cap, potentially discarding vulnerability-relevant edges.

**L2.6 — 51 contradictory-label groups** (102 entries), all Devign.

**L2.7 — LVDAndro labels are scanner-derived, and shortcut-prone.** Ground truth is the union of
MobSF and QARK findings (§8b.5); the LVDAndro authors note both "rely on signatures." A single
`Log.x()` regex reproduces 82.95% of the labels in our LVDAndro test subset. Reported accuracy on
this source therefore measures agreement with a signature scanner, upper-bounded by that scanner's
own false-negative rate, and should not be quoted as vulnerability-detection capability.

**L2.8 — The language router mis-routes 28.1% of Juliet.** *Root cause located 2026-09-02:*
`dataset_creation_scripts/parse.py` `guess_language()` tests for `import `, `class `, `package `
and `public static void main` — **all file-scope markers** — then falls through to
`return 'c'  # Default fallback`. A bare Java **method body** contains none of them, so it is
parsed as C. Reproducing the heuristic offline accounts for **99.2%** of the affected samples.
LVDAndro escapes only because its windowing pulls in file-scope lines, so one defect accidentally
masks the other. The heuristic sends **7,026 of 25,000 Juliet samples (28.1%)** to the C
path, wrapping Java bodies in `void dummy_function() { … }` and parsing them under the C grammar.
Draper and Devign are affected at 0.6% and 0.2%; LVDAndro not at all. The DFGs for those 7,026
samples are extracted from a failed parse. **Juliet still scores 100.0000%** (§3.5), so the
practical impact is nil — but that is itself the point worth making: a quarter of the source can be
parsed under the wrong grammar without measurable loss, which is stronger evidence that synthetic
test cases are trivially separable than the duplication argument in §6.12 ever was.

## 9.3 Model and architecture

**L3.1 — ~~Sliding-window DFG filtering is imprecise~~ → superseded; the real limit is truncation.**
The substring-match issue (`node[0] in chunk_code`, where `i` matches any chunk containing the
letter) is real but lives in `old_train/scanner-pipeline-final.ipynb`, which no reported result
uses. **The shipped scanner truncates at 384 tokens with no windowing at all** (§6.8).

> ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-09-02.** This entry previously read "roughly a fifth of functions lose
> everything past the cut," carrying a corpus-wide figure into a statement about the scanner. That
> fifth is driven almost entirely by the C/C++ sources the scanner never sees. Approximate share of
> test functions exceeding 384 tokens, by source (chars-per-token bracketed 3.0–4.0):
>
> | Source | n | median chars | exceeds 384 tokens |
> |---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
> | **LVDAndro** (Java) | 7,482 | 610 | **0.9 – 2.7%** |
> | Draper | 6,856 | 734 | 18.1 – 30.2% |
> | Devign | 2,388 | 967 | 35.3 – 44.1% |
> | Juliet | 1,815 | 1,073 | 43.6 – 48.6% |
> | all | 18,541 | 665 | 15.8 – 22.7% |
>
> **Caveat that matters more than the table.** LVDAndro records are our own 11-row windows
> (§3.5b), not natural methods, so they are a weak proxy for the length of a real decompiled APK

> distribution of Test 9's 23,005 scanned functions, which lives in the `*_vuln_report.json` files
> on Kaggle and is not in this repo. Until that exists, do not quote a percentage for the scanner.

**L3.2 — Single-function analysis scope.** Models classify functions in isolation, with no
access to calling context, class-level state or inter-function flows. A substantial fraction of
real vulnerabilities are inter-procedural (pattern P7) and no single-function model can detect
them regardless of architecture.

**L3.3 — Context window truncation.** 384 tokens; the sliding window cannot recover signals
spanning chunk boundaries. Sequences up to 2,543 tokens were observed in Devign. Measured on the
18,541-sample test set: median function is 665 characters, p90 is 2,093 and p99 is 5,626, so
roughly a fifth of functions exceed a 384-token window at all.

**L3.4 — Evaluation window is uniform, training windows were not.** All six models are scored at
384 tokens, but GraphCodeBERT text-only was trained at 512 and UniXcoder+DFG at 256+64. About 6%
of test samples are long enough for the difference to matter. Uniformity was chosen so the
within-backbone comparison receives identical input; the alternative trades a bounded measurement
error for an unbounded confound (§3.1). Paper framing: *"All models are evaluated under an
identical 384-token window. Two were pre-trained by us at other lengths; approximately 6% of test
functions are long enough for this to affect their inputs, and we accept that bounded error in
exchange for a strictly like-for-like comparison."*

## 9.4 Evaluation and deployment

**L4.1 — Real-APK evaluation lacks ground truth.** 13 reports, 23,005 functions, reported as
rates and probability distributions. No labelling of which specific functions are genuinely
vulnerable, so precision and recall cannot be computed. The calibration result is an indirect
inference, not a direct measurement.

**L4.2 — App-level flag rates do not separate vulnerable from clean applications.** InsecureShop
flags at 3.6% against AntennaPod's 7.2%, and AntennaPod also outranks Vuldroid (6.4%) and DVBA
(6.5%). Deliberately vulnerable apps average 7.74% against 3.80% for FOSS apps — separated on the
mean, but with ranges overlapping on three of six clean apps (§3.7). The system cannot be used as
an APK-level classifier; it is a function-level triage signal, and an app's flag rate reflects
coding style and size as much as security posture. Paper framing: *"We make no app-level claim.
Aggregate flag rates characterise the deployed system's behaviour; they do not discriminate
vulnerable applications from safe ones."*

**L4.3 — Commercial obfuscation defeats targeted filtering.** ProGuard/DexGuard collapse package
namespaces to single-letter paths, defeating the manifest-aware developer-code filter. The most
security-sensitive production apps are precisely those most likely to use it.

**L4.4 — Static analysis scope.** No access to runtime state, dynamic values, external
configuration or interaction flows.

**L4.5 — Juliet.** Reported separately, excluded from capability claims (§6.12).

## 9.5 External validity

**L5.1 — Devign domain gap** limits any C/C++ claim. The system should not be presented as a
general C/C++ vulnerability detector.

**L5.2 — Source imbalance.** LVDAndro and Draper contribute 75,000 each; Devign and Juliet
25,000 each. Learned representations are dominated by the first two.

**L5.3 — No SOTA comparison** (§6.3).

# Part 10 — Repository and provenance

## 10.1 Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `dataset/dataset_graphcodebert.jsonl` | training corpus, 199,960 entries — **untouched** |
| `dataset/dataset_graphcodebert_dedup.jsonl` | released corpus, 189,938 entries |
| `training_notebooks/re_train/` | the six training notebooks, each carrying its own run's outputs |
| `training_notebooks/old_train/` | the pre-remediation notebooks — historical, do not run |
| `test_scripts/` | all evaluation scripts, plus `split_and_filter.py` and `scanner-pipeline.ipynb` |
| `test_scripts/test_3_multiseed/` | the three multi-seed notebooks (cold start, 10/2) |
| `test_scripts/superseded/` | withdrawn scripts, kept for provenance — **do not run** |
| `dataset_creation_scripts/` | raw APK → JSONL pipeline, plus `make_dedup_dataset.py` |
| `results/models/*.txt` | per-model training results |
| `results/` | evaluation outputs and figures |
| `APKs/` | the 13 APKs used for Test 9 |

**Everything is in one place as of 2026-08-04.** The `new_tests/` and `new_tests_ran/` staging
directories were folded into the canonical tree: the corrected evaluation scripts replaced their
predecessors in `test_scripts/`, and the executed CodeBERT retrains replaced the old Partition-B
notebooks in `training_notebooks/re_train/`. Two files were deleted rather than moved —
`test_scripts/test_3_multiseed.py`, which trained GraphCodeBERT+DFG while Table 3 reports
text-only, and the three duplicate `test-3-seed*.ipynb` copies that sat in the repository root.

## 10.2 Output-filename offset (documented, not fixed)

Scripts 3–6 write results numbered one higher than the script. Fixing only some would make it
less consistent, so it is all four or none — deferred until results are final.

| Script | Writes | |
|---|---|---|
| test-2-roc-auc | `test2_*` | ✓ |
| test_3_multiseed | `test4_multiseed_results.txt` | +1 |
| test-4-per-source | `test5_per_source_*` | +1 |
| test-5-mlp-baseline | `test6_baseline_*` | +1 |
| test-6-imbalanced | `test7_imbalanced_*` | +1 |
| test-7-qualitative | `test7_qualitative_*` | — |
| test-8-significance | `test8_*` | ✓ |
| test_9_scanner | `test9_*` | ✓ |

A rename breaks the figure filenames referenced throughout this document.

## 10.3 Fixes already applied to the evaluation scripts

| File | Fallback removed | Duplicate filter | Verified |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `test-2-roc-auc.py` | n/a | ✓ *after* the split guard | ✓ |
| `test-4-per-source.py` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `test-5-mlp-baseline.py` | n/a | ✓ | ✓ |
| `test-6-imbalanced-eval.py` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `test-7-qualitative-analysis.py` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Each was verified by executing its own split block against the real dataset; all five reproduce
`163,967 / 15,997 / 19,996 → 18,541 clean`.

Incidental fixes made along the way:

- **test-2**: the duplicate filter runs *after* the split guard. The guard compares against
  `test_indices.npy` from the training notebooks, which holds the full 19,996; filtering first
  would fail the guard spuriously and look like a split mismatch.
- **test-2**: the guard is **fail-closed** and searches `/kaggle/input` and `/kaggle/working`
  recursively — a missing file is an error, not a silent skip.
- **test-4**: source logic split in two — `infer_source()` builds the split and deliberately
  finds nothing; `source_for_reporting()` recovers the source from the filename prefix for table
  rows only.
- **test-5**: streams the corpus instead of materialising all 199,960 entries with their `dfg`
  arrays on top of the TF-IDF matrices.
- **test-6**: threshold moved 0.5 → 0.60, and the threshold sweep is now written to the results
  file — which is what §6.7 needs.
- **test-7**: false negatives now record `corpus_idx` and `source`, so they are traceable across
  models and runs. **A results writer was added** — previously the top-20 existed nowhere but a
  Kaggle console log. Now writes `test7_qualitative_results.txt` and
  `test7_false_negatives.json`; numpy `float32`/`int64` casts fixed so `json.dump` no longer
  raises at the end of the run.
- **CodeBERT notebooks**: source-key loading streams the file instead of parsing all 199,960
  entries a second time, which was OOMing the kernel before epoch 1.

## 10.4 Blockers and loose ends

1. ~~**Checkpoint paths are blank.**~~ **Resolved 2026-08-12.** tests 2, 4, 6 and 7 now
   auto-resolve each checkpoint under `/kaggle/input` and **print the path they resolved**, so
   model provenance lands in the run log automatically — the thing whose absence let the split
   mismatch hide for two months. Canonical copy: `test_scripts/resolve_checkpoints.py`.
   It matches on `<dir>/<file>` rather than filename alone, because three different checkpoints
   are named `best_model.bin`; zero matches and two-or-more matches are both hard errors, so it
   never guesses. Setting an Args field by hand still overrides the search. Tested against a
   simulated Kaggle tree covering all six checkpoints, the `best_model.bin` collision, prefix
   bleed between `saved_models/` and `saved_models_unixcoder/`, duplicate attachment, missing
   files and truncated files.
   Fixed while wiring it in: **`test-7-qualitative-analysis.py` never imported `os`** despite
   already calling `os.path.exists` on its weights path — it would have raised `NameError` on
   its first checkpoint check.
2. **Split guard needs a manual copy.** Training notebooks write `test_indices.npy` into their
   own output dirs; test-2 searches the Kaggle input dir. Upload the training run's output as a
   dataset and attach it.
3. **Unexplained drift.** test-2 reports GCB text at 88.78% / ROC 0.9612 and UniXcoder+DFG at
   89.07% / ROC 0.9621, but their notebooks say 88.93% / 0.9596 and 88.37% / 0.9602. Same
   partition, so they should match — likely a wrong checkpoint path in a Kaggle run. **Confirm
   during step 4.**
4. **`graphcodebert-train-dfg.ipynb` has cleared training outputs** — the one model whose numbers
   cannot be cross-checked against its own notebook.
5. **`test_3_multiseed.py` trains GraphCodeBERT+DFG**, but the three seed notebooks train
   text-only and Table 3 reports text-only. The notebooks are canonical; that `.py` should be
   **deleted, not fixed.**
6. **test-4 and test-7 run on GraphCodeBERT+DFG**, not UniXcoder as the pre-consolidation docs
   claimed. Validity is unaffected — both are on Partition N once fixed — but describe them
   correctly in Section 4.
7. **AMP**: `unixcoder-dfg-final.ipynb` is the only notebook still importing the deprecated
   `torch.cuda.amp`; the other five are on `torch.amp`. (An earlier note named
   `codebert-train-text.ipynb` here — that was wrong, it was already on `torch.amp`.)

## 10.5 Corpus-description fixes for the released artifact (post-submission)

Keep `CWE_ID` or emit one row per Draper function; exclude Juliet methods whose body contains
only calls to `goodG2B` / `goodB2G`.

## Document history

Consolidated 2026-08-04 from `README.md` (results sections), `RESEARCH_NOTES.md`,
`PAPER_DEFENSE.md`, `PAPER_TODO.md`, `REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`, `SPLIT_MISMATCH.md`,
`LIMITATIONS.md`, `after_inspection.md`, `analysis_results.md` and `instructions/README.md`.
Contradictions between those files were resolved against the code and the result files; stale
material was dropped rather than carried forward. The originals remain in git history.
